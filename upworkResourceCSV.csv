You need to look at you traffic, opt-in rates, referrals, etc.TESTIMONIES FROM PREVIOUS UPWORK CLIENTS:"Alex is a great writer and produced some fine articles for me. He has a strong sense of the sales process. I'll hire him again""Alex did a great job understanding our niche and creating content that was not filled with fluff. This was extremely important as the content was for C-level executives.""Alex really impressed me by asking detailed questions before beginning the project. He also suggested several good blog titles and considered SEO implications. Delivery was on time and he made revisions quickly."WHY CLIENTS LOVE AND CHOSE ME:As a web copywriter, I have been able to produce above average opt-in rates, sales, and lead generation. (You can see in my portfolio on how I achieved a 42% email open rate -- 300% above industry average).I have been able to get these results because I take a different approach than most copywriters:1. I look at your entire online funnel. Sometimes, we can get a higher ROI by foucsing on a different part of your business.2. I take the time to DEEPLY understand your customer. I find out what keeps them awake until 3am in the morning, what they dream about, and their frustrations. 3. I use the EXACT language your audience uses (Hint: Men who workout would never say, "I want to fit into those high school jeans.").4. And more...If your copy doesn't catch your audience's attention, connect to them emotionally, and compel them to take action, then nothing else matters. Copy is the key to a successful online business.Imagine being able to double your sales with effective copywriting techniques.

I do this worldwide for companies, oganisations, individuals and other translation agencies.The world is getting smaller. Borders are disappearing and it is never been so easy to do international business. Translation is more than subject words from one language into the other. You want the meaning of the message stays the same. That is why it is important that you choose for a reliable translator who is conscious of your message and the audience.Some see automatic translations as a solution. You get the translation right at the moment, and indeed, it is also free. But what kind of translation you will get when this is done by a machine? Almost everyone knows that Google translate-translations are unreliable. The translations often contain grammatical errors and sometimes mess up the hole text.I am available for translations of the next combinations:* English                       -   Dutch (100% score on the test),* Dutch                         -   English,* German                      -   Dutch,* German                      -   English,* Brazilian Portuguese -   English,* English                       -   Brazilian Portuguese,* Brazilian Portuguese -   Dutch,* Dutch                         -   Brazilian Portuguese* Spanish                      -   Dutch,* Spanish                      -   English.Another advantage for you might be that my IT skills are at a higher level than average. I can translate text inside of html, php, Indesign, Acrobat, AutoCad, pdf and so on.;Remco Peters;February 23, 2017;22.5;November 20, 2016;5;~01686ca7afe534ef7d;1;4.9627411843

My passion has always been to use data-driven marketing techniques to create an authentic, meaningful dialogue between a brand and its audience. My goal is to marry the creative aspects of marketing such as copywriting and design, to the strategic implementation of market research and metrics. Key Achievements: 	Clients don't have unlimited resources, so choosing the right strategies is important. I've helped retail clients achieved email rates of over 40% by leveraging highly segmentable client data and creating valuable content targeted it to the right audience. 	Time is money and we all only have 24 hours per day. Implementing automation technology to streamline social media outreach while increasing followers has saved my clients hundreds of hours. 	The right tools make all the difference. By mastering analytics and SEO tools, I've helped clients optimize their digital presence and visibility in many ways, such as decreasing bounce rates by over 20% and improving keyword visibility. In my books, every initiative is an opportunity to gain more insight and continually improve marketing strategies.Here's how I help clients achieve their objectives through dynamic marketing strategies:Execute innovative strategies. Guide campaigns through implementing best practices, leveraging strengths, and capitalizing on opportunities. Conceive brand and develop pricing based on industry research, competitive analysis, and market segmentation. Combine creative copywriting with methodical keyword research to create content such as case studies, whitepapers, andblog posts. Customize content for digital outlets, websites, mobile apps, blogs, webinars, and social media platforms. Manage web development projects including design, information architecture, user experience, and A/B testing. Boost digital visibility by curating pay-per-click (PPC), search engine marketing (SEM), and search engine optimization (SEO)strategies for targeted keywords.Identify opportunities to captivate the target audience. Determine initiatives that present the best fit with company objectives and desired target market segment. Engage in digital PR outreach and link building to increase brand awareness through relevant, high domain authority mediaoutlets. Lead robust email marketing campaigns, employing campaign automation and A/B testing of subject line, messaging, layout,and landing pages. Foster cross-promotional relationships to extend brand presence and gain insight on shared target audiences. Leverage social media marketing to deliver value-driven content, optimized to reflect the unique context of each platform. Perform gap-analyses to gauge stages of the marketing funnel that require additional resources.Emphasize data-driven marketing methods and measurable success. Track key performance indicators, conversion paths, and attribution in order to calculate ROI and optimize campaigns. Analyze vital website metrics such as time on site, bounce rate, and exit pages to guide on site optimizations. Create frameworks to tie together offline and online information from various sources. Evaluate revenue by customer segment and product division to identify trends and how to pivot marketing focus. Assess return on non-digital marketing channels such as print advertisement and direct mailings, allowing for the strategicallocation of marketing budget.;Aarti G.;February 19, 2017;50.0;April 8, 2015;2;~01a0d1998d17be8cb0;2;0.0

Thanks for visiting my profile! I hope you're here because you think I might be a good fit for your job, so I'll briefly fill you in on a couple of relevant things about me:1. I love to write, but I'm not a writer who just proofreads and edits when there aren't any writing gigs. I love grammar and having a part in shaping a document. Nothing makes me happier than well-organized, coherent, error-free writing!2. My schedule - I am self-employed as an educator and freelancer, so I have a pretty flexible schedule and am often available to turn around projects quickly.3. My education - I have a background in theology with a strong reading background and interest in philosophy. (I have a minor in music and am a very serious hobbyist, for whatever that's worth.)4. My experience - I have proofread and edited papers, theses, and dissertations in a variety of disciplines including business, science, technology, humanities, musicology, psychology, and philosophy. This includes a familiarity with many academic style guides (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). I also have experience working with blog writers and essayists.I have extensive experience with documents by ESL writers.If you have any questions about me, please contact me. I'd be happy to set up a time to chat with you about your project!Thanks,Kristen;Kristen S.;November 3, 2016;15.0;October 26, 2015;0;~015e918add8e3d2e2f;4;5.0

Football is my passion since I was little and since 2010 I'm really glad that I started to turn this hobby of mine into a living. Between 2010 and 2011 I started my career as a sport journalist in my local newspaper, where I was writing articles about all kind of world football news and matches. In the summer of 2011 I had an intership in one of the biggest sport newspapers in my country, where I was also making the daily feed with news and articles about the world football. But since then I'm working with this newspaper in more specific way, as every weekend I'm responsible for two pages of the newspaper, where I write picks and previews for the Spanish and French leagues before every round, where I inform our readers about the upcoming games, injuries, form, the things I have watches in the previous rounds and so on, to help them, if they are about to make some bets on those matches. Also I have a blog on my own, where I also write picks and previews about the French and Spanish football and you can see it below: http://dimitarhorozov.blogabet.com/;Dimitar Horozov;February 23, 2017;5.56;September 4, 2013;0;~015d183cc5c7709dc1;0;3.4906807131

Kirsten L.Managing Partner, Rethink ComplianceAnthony is one of those writers who you dream to work with!- Marlee K., Editor at AskMen.com (world's #1 men's lifestyle site)---How many other marketers on Upwork can say theyve lead successful digital marketing, copywriting, and email marketing projects for:- A $150mm health and fitness brand- A top-selling and award-winning health and nutrition brand- Art of Tea, a leading retailer/wholesaler of fine organic teas- Ramit Sethi's I Will Teach You To Be Rich (an educational company with over 500,000 email subscribers) - Publications like GQ, Mens Health, and Mens Fitness- Places like CLIF Bar, SumoMe, Cellucor, and KISSmetrics. (Feel free to check my Employment and Portfolio sections to see what I did.)I've seen what it takes to succeed. Now, I help smaller, fast-moving, agile, and fun companies grow to these levels. But Ive also seen what holds companies back. And I want to share them below. TOP 3 MARKETING MISTAKES FOR GROWING BUSINESS: 1. Not understanding the customerIn early 2016, a music company who sold digital products approached me to help them launch a new flagship product. Cool, I thought. I asked them what kind of research they did on their customer and their answer was ZERO.My jaw hit the floor. How do they know people even want it? Does this solve a pain? What pain? How do you speak to that pain? How would they know it even sells? With the right research, you can VIRTUALLY GUARANTEE profits before you even RELEASE A PRODUCT. Better still, it makes your copywriting, your email marketing, and your digital strategies SO MUCH STRONGER. But research is more than just asking your audience if theyll buy something. Over the years, Ive learned the EXACT questions to ask to unlock your potential customers hidden fears, desires, and goal things they dont share with anyone else. 2. Wasting money on things that DONT WORKThe most expensive marketing is marketing that doesnt get results. Ive worked at companies with infinite budgets. But although they had money to burn, they still wasted it doing things that DIDNT MATTER. For example, I worked with an 8-figure company that wanted a blog. I told them to save their money and focus on other, better channels to grow their traffic. They didn't listen and spent A LOT of money on specialty writers. 6 months  and almost a 100 articles  later, they FINALLY listened to me because their blog only generated a total of ~$130. (Remember.. its an 8-figure company!)So what should YOU focus on? Paid ads? SEO? WOM? Content? Well, thats what your competitors do. They try everything.OR, you can just focus on the few strategies that will give you the roadmap to 2x, 3x, or 5x your business. For example, I can increase the open rate of your email marketing by 30% just by harnessing the power of DNOs. Yeah, its a cute tactic, but it falls under a LARGER, OVERARCHING STRATEGY that gets results. 3. BikesheddingDo you know what bikeshedding is?Lets use a digital marketing situation I see a lot. "ANTHONY, SHOULD I GET INFUSIONSOFT, HUBSPOT, PARDOT, MARKETO?"My honest answer? It doesnt matter that much. Just pick something and go with it. Ive consulted on teams where theyve spent WEEKS  if not months  debating things like marketing CRMs, website layouts, and font. Everyone had an opinion! Meanwhile, the companys hook and story was missing. There was no connection with customers. The irresistible offer was lacking. (This made their copywriting, digital marketing, and email marketing weak and pushed AWAY prospects.)But no one chimed in there. THAT is what "bikeshedding" means: The more trivial something is, the more we debate or discuss it and vice versa. Stop wasting time, energy, and money. With me on your team, Ill make sure you NEVER do.With that said, Im very particular about the projects I take on. Part of being a great digital marketer is being great at selecting projects that have the foundation to be winners and working with people who are serious about results. My reputation is always on the line so you can bet Ill do everything I can to make it a blowout success (if were a fit). If you're keen, feel free to contact me using the greeen "Invite a Job" button at the top of the page and we can see if theres a fit.

My first degree was an Associate in Applied Science degree in Veterinary Technology, and after working for a few years in that capacity, I returned to school to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree in French.

I received my Bachelors in Business & Economic Development at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, GA in May 2013 taking such classes as Professional Writing and Research Methods. I graduated with a 3.94 GPA. I am currently in the International MBA program at the University of North Carolina Wilmington with my specialization in International Finance and Investments and will be graduating this upcoming May. As this is a dual-degree, I completed the first half of the program at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany last fall. For my first degree, my focus was business and economic development with many hands-on writing projects. For example, I acted as a team member in helping write the business plan and deliver an award-winning presentation at the First Annual University System of Georgia Social Business Plan Competition in 2011. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, I created a pitch for a platform that connects exercise enthusiasts for the 2014 Innovation Concept Pitch Competition. I received 1st Place for the idea and presentation. During my employment with the Georgia Peanut Commission, I was responsible for social media campaigning, as well as research and promotion efforts. In my position as Business Apprentice for Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, my primary goal was to manage the operations of the Stafford School of Business. This included maintaining the website, school promotions, and purchases. I had to be a self-starter, flexible, and work well under pressure to excel with this position. I completed an internship last year with Pure Communications, an integrated communications agency specializing in public and investor relations and digital communications for the life sciences industry. I assisted with research, media list development, and proofing materials.I enjoy researching/writing about current trends in the market and am working on my masters thesis about how black swan events impact firm investment behavior. I look forward to taking my love for writing and attention to detail in assisting you with your academic/business writing or proofreading needs!;Elisabeth O'Quinn;December 7, 2016;15.0;September 5, 2016;3;~01aece96448e043570;2;5.0

For many years, my friends and family members have all solicited my advice and guidance with their cover letters, applications and resumes. The number one thing I have noticed is that it is not experience that inhibits personal success it is branding. I believe that the opportunities you will receive are directly correlated to your ability to invest others in your brand. This might not sound revolutionary- it is not- however what most do not realize is that despite whatever level of investment or belief you have in yourself it is extremely difficult for most people to accurately convey that in written form.Frankly,  I have cultivated this skill in my own life and received grants, scholarships and job prospects that I was perhaps (purely looking at prior experiences) either under qualified for or unqualified for. I was able to ascertain the skills the reviewer/ admissions committee were looking for- both listed and unlisted and leverage the experiences I did have in order to convince them that I was deserving of the opportunity. I would like the opportunity to do that for you. Upon request I am happy to provide previous before and afters( cover letters).Previous experience with:Law school personal statementsInternship applicationsTailoring generic cover letters to fit organizations/ specific job experiencesRestructuring newspaper articlesGrant writingNon-profit brandingNon- profit donor letter writingServices offered:Cover letter consultationRsum restructuring1 hour job search consultation- 30 minutes reviewing your materials, 30 minutes skype discussion about improvementsUpon request I am happy to discuss other potential writing services;Kathryn B.;May 31, 2014;50.0;April 25, 2014;0;~0110e76715aa47db0f;0;0.0

I soon became fascinated, however, by a city that is growing a digital marketing hub, oozing creativity, & fuelling a friendly planmaking culture.If you run a start-up you know how chaotic things can be.

I am an MBA graduate with over 7 years of Business Development experience in BPO, immigration, tourism & recruitment. This allows me to look at a companys existing marketing strategy & make suggestions for improvement.Unlike many other marketing experts, I am hands-on when it comes to implementing marketing strategy. I also have a proven track record of designing professional successful WP websites, drafting copy, conceptualising email campaigns, coming up with nifty social media campaigns, creating brochures & company profiles & using successful white-hat SEO methods.Passionate about people & convinced that someone who spends 683 760 h of his life working deserves a job that makes him happy, I have been beefing up Initiate Internationals marketing since May 2013.

(more detail in work history)Do my strategies work in current day?As of March 27th, 2016, all of my strategies are not only 100% white hat, but also refreshingly in-depth, founded upon tested methodologies, and recommended best practices by both industry leaders, and Google Guidelines. Not to mention that I read & study more than I did in school. I just achieved a "1 Box" ranking for my clients local market in February 2016, and you can also see a case study with data pulled from a clients Adwords account in March 2016 in my portfolio.Sometimes being able to think outside of the box is important right?My job doesn't stop at evaluating SEO for potential and current clients. I look at all marketing channels (online & offline), and always focus on one simple thing. Generating respectable R.O.I. within a prospects budget.Will all changes be approved and my ownership/brand be protected?Every single change that is made will either be directly approved by the decision maker (you), or proxy can be given for me to make discretionary updates after you see that I don't make spelling/grammar errors, or ever misrepresent your brand and earn your trust. Furthermore, 100% of work, assets, and results will be owned and controlled by my clients (I can't stand some of the sleezy people who are keeping login credentials, registering info in their accounts/names, etc, in order to hold clients over the barrel when they try to leave.) Beware of any activity that seems like they want to maintain access/control and not provide it to you. Even some large U.S. agencies engage in this style of business model. Sadly in most cases it's not illegal, and can't be forced, however it is always unpleasant and highly un-ethical.;Tyler Abernethy;April 14, 2016;57.0;March 25, 2016;1;~011411e63eae446378;4;1.2

I am Carina Hoellersberger from Austria. I have a B.A. in communication studies and a M.A. in Social and Cultural Anthropology. The main and leading question in anthropology is: What do certain things mean to people in a particular context? This question is not only important for anthropology, it also is a basic reflection for creative writing, because it helps you to rethink and to focus even more on your target group. And in the end, further comprehension of your target group leads to better results.  What can I offer you? - Empathic and passionate writing for websites, blogs or books. - My native tongue is German, but I am fluent in Spanish and English. Thus, if your job requires any translation from Spanish or English to German, I am also happy to offer you that service. - Transcription of interviews or other recordings.

For them, I have written around 2.000 blog articles alone so that I could offer my services on that field as well.I am married to an American citizen and plan to emigrate to the United States in 2017 where I am also planning to earn my certification as a translator and interpreter at California State University. I would like the opportunity in utilizing my translation experience by assisting individuals and/ or businesses in translating English-language requests into concise, naturally-fluent German.

And more importantly am I going to listen and communicate clearly.Language may also be a concern of yours. I am a native English speaker who has previous experience working remotely, and know the communication issues with this type of online work.Affordability is also essential.  Check my rates and consider how much more "bang for the buck". The cheapest may not always be better.   I am trying to give you the best of both worlds.You also want enthusiasm.  Someone who really cares.  Someone who will put in research (on their own time!) and think before suggesting a solution. The worst thing is for you to hire the wrong person, lose time and money, only to have to begin again.  Of course, you also need practical skills.  I am someone who has over three (3) experience with interpreting technical data, developing custom tools for jobs and organizing plans, contacts, actions and data. I am  passionate about writing, researching and organizing thoughts into paper.So why am I here on Upworks?  It is my absolute dream to be able to earn a living working for others remotely so that I am also able to focus on my own writing.  I simply can't do that with a traditional job.  This means I can flex around YOUR schedule, work on a fixed price project or hourly, whatever suits you.  This also means I can work whatever time of day you would like.  I am not bound to US time.A business associate once told me you hire FIRST "for the person" and SECOND "for the skills".  I hope to be both for you.;Cara McKinney;September 16, 2016;12.5;July 19, 2016;3;~01a43190eca5b279f1;5;5.0

I am a freelance writer with three years of writing experience. Writing has always been my joy! I remember how I wrote short stories on a typewriter as a child, allowing my imagination to run wild -- playing in my mind as a movie in a video-player. Writing is my necessity for living as much as breathing, eating, and sleeping. If I don't write something...anything, I find myself going into a withdrawal, fidgeting, looking for something to write about. I love how words look on both paper and the computer screen,  their distinctive shapes, and the worlds they create.

Though I may not have much professional experience to boast about, I do have years of schooling and academic experience still floating about fresh in my fledgling mind.  As I have no major career oriented accomplishments to advertise, and I am still in school, I am left with only myself as a hook, and so I shall attempt to bait it well. Writing has been a growing hobby of mine for the larger part of the past decade. This particular pursuit stems from a passion for the (often times infuriating) english language. I love being capable of creating worlds with the rearranging of twenty-four little letters, captivating the psyche of minds I may never meet outside of the written universe. If you'll let me, I'd like to use these talents to help you "talk" to people in this way, too. Though writing is, and always will be, my main passion, it is not my sole profession. When the ink runs dry, I also freelance as a video/audio transcriptionist, and have worked avidly through many acceptable online companies, the most prominent being Rev.com. I have worked tirelessly to expand my expertise in both fields, and pride myself on the accuracy and alacrity of my finished assignments. My schedule is incredibly flexible, and my hourly rate more so. I hope to hear from you soon!;Phoebe Stacey;March 10, 2016;10.0;October 14, 2015;1;~01ddf30b583d70ac2c;0;5.0

NATIVE SPEAKERI grew up in a mountain town close to Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. During my formative years I studied basic French, German, and English but my college classes included Portuguese, Greek, Latin, Literature, and Linguistics. I also studied Spanish and English.ADVANCED ENGLISH - I moved to the United States 29 years ago. New York was my home for 10 years but I currently reside in Florida. - My business specialty was videotaping depositions, which gave me a good understanding of the Legal, Technical, and Medical terminology. - Another area I have quite a lot of experience is Real Estate, both residential and commercial. - I am an avid handbag maker, and I enjoy many arts & crafts projects.PROJECTS1) Teaching English & Cultural Adaptation While working in Real Estate, I formed a partnership with a Brazilian PhD Psychologist to develop a cultural adaptation program directed at assisting Brazilian expatriates, businesspersons and families who moved to the metropolitan area of Tampa, FL, not only to learn the everyday language but also to understand what they could expect and what would be expected of them during their stay in the United States.2) Translating a Large WebsiteEtsy.com started their translation efforts to translate the whole site into Portuguese around August 2012. I have been in their translation team ever since. They'd asked me to assume a Leadership position around December of that year, which I was glad to accept. The project involves the continuous translation of thousands of strings, first into the European Portuguese and, on a second phase, into the Brazilian Portuguese, using an online translation platform.3) Blog WritingI have written a number of articles for different blogs.

Other software tools I have are Adobe Acrobat professional version so I can provide you with a secure, watermarked PDF version of your document. I am an intermediate user of Adobe Illustrator and a beginner with Adobe Photoshop. I also can create excellent MS Powerpoint presentations. I also have the Mac and Open Office versions of their presentation tools. I have some Masters level education. I always took advantage of employer educational benefits and took several masters level electronics classes from Oregon Graduate Institute. While working as a technical writer at Mentor Graphics, I took three Masters level courses on technical writing at Portland State University. Work Ethic:  I only submit bids for jobs that I have the skills to do.I do NOT do any writing or academic work that students should do for themselves. (I do edit/proofreading of the English however)Tests on this website: I really enjoy taking them! They are not easy. But they are useful in figuring out what one knows. I have chosen to leave those I do not pass such as UNIX. I have never done UNIX programming but I did install software on UNIX systems and if you open the test results you will see 100% on basic commands even though I did not do well on writing shell scripts and so on. The same with Instrumentation Electronics. I passed both the Analog 71% and 100% Transducer subsections of the test, and Optical Instrumentation, well there I scored not a single point the first time around. Second time around I passed it but only got 50% on Analog and less on the transducers. I also earned a TESOL certification. I taught ESL English for a year in Istanbul both to adults and children. I worked in the health care industry as a nurse from 1979 up until 1995 while I was working on my engineering degree.;Mary Tsolak;December 7, 2016;50.0;May 1, 2015;3;~019f242307234b72a0;26;5.0

I specialize in the editing and proofreading of academic papers, professional journal submissions and the writing of user guides and training materials. I have completed thesis editing/proofreading projects following these style guides: APA, Harvard, IEEE, and CMOS. I am a member of IEEE and have access to the full current style guide. I have a degree in Electronics Engineering with seven years experience as an in-house technical writer in the US  semiconductor industry. I would like to do more technical writing related to electronics and software development. I have used and have access to the following word processing tools: Open Office, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Office 2016, and Mac Pages. I am familiar with LaTex and FrameMaker also however I do not have access to them. Other software tools I have are Adobe Acrobat professional version so I can provide you with a secure, watermarked PDF version of your document. I am an intermediate user of Adobe Illustrator and a beginner with Adobe Photoshop. I also can create excellent MS Powerpoint presentations. I also have the Mac and Open Office versions of their presentation tools. I have some Masters level education. I always took advantage of employer educational benefits and took several masters level electronics classes from Oregon Graduate Institute. While working as a technical writer at Mentor Graphics, I took three Masters level courses on technical writing at Portland State University. Work Ethic:  I only submit bids for jobs that I have the skills to do.I do NOT do any writing or academic work that students should do for themselves. (I do edit/proofreading of the English however)Tests on this website: I really enjoy taking them! They are not easy. But they are useful in figuring out what one knows. I have chosen to leave those I do not pass such as UNIX. I have never done UNIX programming but I did install software on UNIX systems and if you open the test results you will see 100% on basic commands even though I did not do well on writing shell scripts and so on. The same with Instrumentation Electronics. I passed both the Analog 71% and 100% Transducer subsections of the test, and Optical Instrumentation, well there I scored not a single point the first time around. Second time around I passed it but only got 50% on Analog and less on the transducers. I also earned a TESOL certification. I taught ESL English for a year in Istanbul both to adults and children. I worked in the health care industry as a nurse from 1979 up until 1995 while I was working on my engineering degree.;Mary Tsolak;December 7, 2016;50.0;May 1, 2015;3;~019f242307234b72a0;26;5.0

CA and Philippines. I'm an environmental advocate and a lacto pesco vegetarian. I home schooled my two sons who are now grown. I'm a good researcher and I am great with teaching art to children and adults as well. My cup is not full. In fact, I look forward to share and learn with each project.  I'm great with  line art .I can render in watercolor ,acrylic and oil, depending on the project and time element. I am more of an abstract  artist and have a specific style which shows in my artwork as well. My passion is installation of found objects. This background of painting first before learning photoshop gives me a different style in rendering my artwork. I'm a Gen Xer ,so I have seen and experienced the transition from black and white tv, vinyls to cds, analog to digital and the whole transition to social media. It's mind blowing. I love it.I travel and move around a lot that's why online projects work best for me. Right now, I'm in transition to move to a quiet island and focus on painting a series and am looking into graphic and print or fashion design.

Through college and work as a freelancer I gained necessary experience in gathering and researching data by working on numerous projects in variety of economic topics such are Public Sector Economics, Labour Economics, International Economy, Risk Management, Money and Banking, Investment Banking, Competitiveness, Environmental Economics etc. I'm proficient in English since all of my studies from high school (IB Middle Years Programme) to college (University of Buckingham, University of Ljubljana) were on it. My native language is Bosnian and I have perfect understanding of other Slavic languages Serbian/Croatian/Montenegrian, which are more or less the same, so any translation from these languages or vice versa to English I'm more than willing to do. Moreover I'm also willing to do jobs such are data entry, transcription or creating PowerPoint presentations. I have the ability to grasp things fast and hence can master any new skill with ease.

As a writer I make it a priority to allow the readers to dig deep into every word my hands create. From the young age of ten to my current college level now I have always been fascinated with expressing myself through the medium of writing. Graduating from Cottage Grove High School and now attending East Central College my passion for writing has never withered. I have been writing short stories and small comic strips one of which making into a tid bits paper in Waynesville, MO. I can create papers that persuade the audience to view my stance or I can educate them on the given topic, but entertaining my audience is one of my favorite methods to use. As someone who wishes to educate the next generation into learning about the wonders of literature and writing, I take strong pride in my skills in writing.

During my university years, the last year of which was spent at Middlesex University in London with an Erasmus Scholarship, I have developed excellent writing skills in English at a proficiency level, which I was able to put into practice professionally while working as a freelancer here on the Odesk platform, writing articles, web content, editing and proofreading documents. From my additional work experience I can extrapolate a particular emphasis on customer service and working in a team, especially at my previous jobs, both in the United States and the United Kingdom. I have proven to be a flexible and adaptable person, willing to take initiative, particularly given my volunteer work as an editor on a TV review website at the age of seventeen. During this volunteering period, I have demonstrated working well of my own accord, with no supervision. Having successfully balanced my academic and professional commitments, I believe it showcases my strong skills in time management and activity coordination, of working well under pressure, as well as a willingness to take on responsibility. I speak Romanian and English fluently and, regarding the latter, I would like to insist upon my spoken and written capabilities. From the very beginning of my university degree, I showcased a near-native level of English, and I will attach a letter of recommendation from an American Fulbright Junior Lecturer that taught at my university during my first year as confirmation of that statement. Furthermore, the subsequent four months of living in the United States and the ten months spent in United Kingdom definitely provided me with a useful medium towards cultivating an even greater knowledge of English.;Marian C.;December 1, 2014;8.89;February 27, 2012;3;~01eefa4b03ae930f70;4;5.0

I worked as a technical support specialist for a telecommunications company based in US. I am always commended for handling and resolving critical customer issues. I always meet aggressive deadlines. I always accomplish ambitious targets that are set by my client. I am frequently praised for being resourceful and innovative in creating alternative options for the customer. I go above and beyond my responsibility. I learned skills that are beyond my specialization. I resolve the issues that are out of my scope of specialization by following instructions from our knowledge based tools. I am good at time management which is why I always have the time to do other freelance jobs.I do other freelance jobs during my free time.My colleagues and my previous clients were satisfied with my flexibility and versatility. Whenever there are people looking for a freelancer, they immediately give my contact information. I worked as a freelancer in various fields. I worked as an English tutor for Koreans, Singaporeans and Chinese. I have an unorthodox but effective way of teaching my clients the English language. My clients already know some English and my job is to further enhance their English communication skills. Instead of just teaching grammar, I find interesting topics which could be the foundation of our healthy conversation. I also let them watch English shows they prefer before our conversation starts, so that we could talk about it during our lecture session. I am proud to say that this unorthodox way has always been effective to all my clients.I also worked as a chat support for the independent campus journalism page we created in college to distribute information about school related queries. I can attend to 10-15 people and answer all their school related questions and requests via facebook chat. We used the page not just to distribute information but to launch campaigns for specific student events. We catapulted constructive reforms in our university that everyone enjoys until today like our integrated online enrollment.I also worked as a researcher for various fields. A researcher needs to extract all the vital information from all the cluttered sources. I did a lot of proof reading from the extracted information as a researcher. I worked for several types of people as a researcher. I have worked for writers, professors, college students and more. I basically, do certain part of their work that needs fact finding, data mining, data analysis and proof reading. Personally, the most rewarding achievement as a researcher is to witness the final output of my contribution. I assist history professors to get all the perspective stories for a specific lecture. I help writers to provide them the gist of the detailed parts of what they are writing. I help students in their research paper when they are running out of time or when they are jammed from streamline work inefficiency. I save them time as a researcher. I am a think tank and people pay me for my furnished ideas. When my creative process is at its peak, I even create the main concept of the project. This is usually tested when people hire me for their thesis. They always end up astounded by my concepts that always stand up during thesis conventions.If you are looking for a freelancer who will work for you for a very long time, please consider my simple qualifications, and I will surprise you with what I can accomplish. I can do almost anything as long as I am given a reasonable amount of time learning about the details of my job. I am really planning to work at home so I could do more out of my time. I am looking forward doing business with you.;Vankroyd Bontia;June 26, 2014;4.44;April 19, 2014;0;~018bf4ab1e2aab34d0;3;5.0

I have already compiled databases of food blogs for two clients. Those data bases were geared toward their individual needs. Both were cookbook authors, one promoting artisinal sodas and the other french cuisine. At present, I am working for Jaime Purviance who is head chef at Weber Grills. I test the website recipes that are sent out to over 500,000 subscribers each Friday. All recipe must adhere to Weber's standards and formatting. Meticulous editing is my specialty. As well I have developed recipes for Melissa's Produce, Driscoll Berries, Casa Noble Tequila and Nest Fresh Eggs to a name a few.On a lighter note - I grew up in New York City and started cooking in my Moms tiny Manhattan kitchen before I can remember. As her loyal steed, we produced cookies, homemade bread and any recipe that tickled our fancy from Gourmet Magazine. I was lucky to grow up on the Upper Westside during its resurgence of eclectic and trendy restaurants, while having Zabaars and Fairway Market at my fingertips.My love of cooking led me to a Bachelor of Science at Cornells School of Hotel Administration where I majored in Food and Beverage, with a minor in wines and food and wine pairing. I worked for a few years in the hotel industry but I ultimately missed the kitchen and compromised on corporate catering.You can view my work at www.virtuallyhomemade.com or www.lizhughesrecipetesting.com.I would love to work with you and your organization.;Elizabeth Hughes;April 20, 2015;16.67;January 8, 2013;0;~018377daf268dee02e;0;4.9932045626

In addition, I have a vary high level of English and have won various awards for the subject during high school including the Dux of grade 10 and 11 English.I have completed multiple translation projects to the satisfaction of the client and am currently providing spanish tutoring to various students in the local area.I am flexible and can easily adapt to the task at hand and I hope to be of assistance for your project.;Makenzie M.;March 18, 2014;16.67;June 23, 2012;0;~01f16e644f1ed47653;8;5.0

When I work on content for my clients, I strive to provide them with the highest quality literature possible - I feel that there is nothing worse than reading an article that is full of spelling mistakes and glaringly obvious grammatical errors, not to mention plagiarism! I am currently saving to complete a proofreading course so that I will be able to "officially" add that skill to my repertoire.. for now, however, I spend my working hours writing quality content for clients both here and on other freelancing platforms - you will see from my feedback that my clients have been very pleased with the work I have completed for them.. I even have long-term clients who continue to hire me for more work.I am available to research and write content on a number of subjects including health, education, current affairs, history, science, philosophy, frugal living and parenting. I have a wide range of interests and love nothing more than delving into a subject to learn as much as possible about it, which is certainly a helpful quality when it comes to researching content for clients.I am a native British English speaker, living in the UK and I am fluent in both written and verbal English. I possess 8 GCSEs and 2 A-Levels, one in English Literature at grade B and one in Psychology at grade C.. I intend to start studying a part-time degree course next year with the Open University. I am not afraid to ask as many questions as I feel are necessary to help me ensure that I can provide high quality content that meets my client's specifications.Whilst I do try to ensure that I communicate regularly with my clients, in order to touch base or discuss the work, I do have children and, therefore, arrange my working hours around them. If I am not online during the day, I can usually be contacted urgently if need be because I do check my emails sporadically throughout the day and will reply as soon as possible if the query is urgent and cannot wait until I am next online. I know that my reliability when it comes to communication is one of the things my clients really like about me and the service that I provide.;Cassie R.;June 14, 2016;15.0;March 25, 2013;0;~015422485c0b0cbd7c;4;4.9698333694

I am a member of Mensa and the Triple Nine Society and am proficient in topics covered in an undergraduate psychology major program of study.  I have completed a rigorous senior thesis course that culminated with the completion of a research paper written in accordance with current accepted APA style.  Also, note the low amounts of time taken for my various tests I have passed.  I took these tests without any prior study that was particularly geared toward any one test.  I feel that by doing so, these tests more accurately reflect a baseline of my skill level than if I had studied at all for any of these tests which would have temporarily artificially inflated my scores.

This is why, despite being the project manager of my design agency, I take a hands on approach and personally work with all of our clients. I have not just focused on one area of design, but I have trained in all the areas that our agency specialises:- Web Design- Graphic Design- SEO- Content Writing- Social Media MarketingI ghost write for celebrity blogs and corporate organisations. I am also a qualified proofreader, so I can nit pick at your content all day long to ensure it sounds amazing!I am a Hootsuite Certified Professional, meaning that I have been trained in social media management and marketing and got the results to prove exactly what I can do! I work with big and small businesses alike, tailoring to their marketing needs. Whatever your industry, social media can be a powerful tool, so let me show you why. SEO is becoming somewhat of a "trend" now as many people are just discovering what it is. However, there will be a lot of you who still don't know exactly what it is and think it is not for them. This is where you are wrong.. SEO could be the difference between your business succeeding or not. Getting cheap SEO is also very unadvisable.. you need someone who knows the industry well and has years of experience. I am not just talking creating backlinks, but you need someone who is well versed in Google's marketing as a complete tool. Upwork is a relatively new platform to my agency, since most of my clients are found through our website or word of mouth. So this profile represents the work that I do for my agency. Our fees are in the mid to upper range due to our experience and broad range of expertise. However, in order to stay competitive on here, I often reduce my fees, but never the quality. All I ask in return is that you give us credit for the work. We will leave a discreet link in the footer of your site to our company page. We also ask that you add an alt description on your logo which may include us. This is how we compensate for our reduced rates on here. Many thanks for agreeing to this and looking forward to working with you!;Kalema L.;January 24, 2017;25.0;March 11, 2011;0;~01cd4063ad61df1a0b;0;0.0

Working on projects from literary short stories, anthology collections, and all the way to novel-length memoirs. My work is strengthened by my education in writing. I am a graduate of Agnes Scott College with a Bachelor's degree in Creative Writing, which has given me a strong sense of character development, scene setting, and story telling.In my time as a freelancer, I have been an interim editor for Houstonia Magazine, acted as a publicity team member for Agnes Scott Colleges Annual Writers Festival and WriteSpace Literary Group, and helped writers develop and polish their memoirs and fiction manuscripts. Each of these opportunities had strengthened my editorial skills and transformed me into a multi-faceted writer.My own work has been published in both original fiction (Aurora Literary Magazine 2012 edition), and in online articles and features writing (Houstonia Magazine, NYU Publishing Institute, etc.) My love has always been in creative writing and video games, and I am eager to help developers with their new projects.;Maggie Berardo;December 5, 2016;12.0;September 17, 2016;1;~017c6bec79bd095254;1;4.85

My first degree was an Associate in Applied Science degree in Veterinary Technology, and after working for a few years in that capacity, I returned to school to complete a Bachelor of Arts degree in French.  It has been several years since I finished that degree, and I listed my proficiency level as basic due to the length of time since I last used it conversationally.

This might not sound revolutionary- it is not- however what most do not realize is that despite whatever level of investment or belief you have in yourself it is extremely difficult for most people to accurately convey that in written form.Frankly,  I have cultivated this skill in my own life and received grants, scholarships and job prospects that I was perhaps (purely looking at prior experiences) either under qualified for or unqualified for. I was able to ascertain the skills the reviewer/ admissions committee were looking for- both listed and unlisted and leverage the experiences I did have in order to convince them that I was deserving of the opportunity. I would like the opportunity to do that for you.

The first book I ever read in English, was the second 'Harry Potter' novel, when I was nine. I've been reading English books ever since.Translating texts from English to Dutch (and of course, the reverse) is a bit of a hobby of mine. Now I've started translating texts and documents more professionally. I've also started doing some research and written some articles about different subjects that are of interest to me. I also have plenty of experience working with PCs, since my full-time job is selling them. So things like adding products to a webstore, sending e-mails to clients etc...

Thanks for visiting my profile! I hope you're here because you think I might be a good fit for your job, so I'll briefly fill you in on a couple of relevant things about me:1. I love to write, but I'm not a writer who just proofreads and edits when there aren't any writing gigs. I love grammar and having a part in shaping a document. Nothing makes me happier than well-organized, coherent, error-free writing!2. My schedule - I am self-employed as an educator and freelancer, so I have a pretty flexible schedule and am often available to turn around projects quickly.3. My education - I have a background in theology with a strong reading background and interest in philosophy. (I have a minor in music and am a very serious hobbyist, for whatever that's worth.)4. My experience - I have proofread and edited papers, theses, and dissertations in a variety of disciplines including business, science, technology, humanities, musicology, psychology, and philosophy. This includes a familiarity with many academic style guides (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). I also have experience working with blog writers and essayists.I have extensive experience with documents by ESL writers.If you have any questions about me, please contact me. I'd be happy to set up a time to chat with you about your project!Thanks,Kristen;Kristen S.;November 3, 2016;15.0;October 26, 2015;0;~015e918add8e3d2e2f;4;5.0

I received my Bachelors in Business & Economic Development at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, GA in May 2013 taking such classes as Professional Writing and Research Methods. I graduated with a 3.94 GPA. I am currently in the International MBA program at the University of North Carolina Wilmington with my specialization in International Finance and Investments and will be graduating this upcoming May. As this is a dual-degree, I completed the first half of the program at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany last fall. For my first degree, my focus was business and economic development with many hands-on writing projects. For example, I acted as a team member in helping write the business plan and deliver an award-winning presentation at the First Annual University System of Georgia Social Business Plan Competition in 2011. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, I created a pitch for a platform that connects exercise enthusiasts for the 2014 Innovation Concept Pitch Competition. I received 1st Place for the idea and presentation. During my employment with the Georgia Peanut Commission, I was responsible for social media campaigning, as well as research and promotion efforts. In my position as Business Apprentice for Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, my primary goal was to manage the operations of the Stafford School of Business. This included maintaining the website, school promotions, and purchases. I had to be a self-starter, flexible, and work well under pressure to excel with this position. I completed an internship last year with Pure Communications, an integrated communications agency specializing in public and investor relations and digital communications for the life sciences industry. I assisted with research, media list development, and proofing materials.I enjoy researching/writing about current trends in the market and am working on my masters thesis about how black swan events impact firm investment behavior. I look forward to taking my love for writing and attention to detail in assisting you with your academic/business writing or proofreading needs!;Elisabeth O'Quinn;December 7, 2016;15.0;September 5, 2016;3;~01aece96448e043570;2;5.0

Needless to say, I have spent most of my life examining music, and all that relates to it.. what makes it palatable to the listener, what makes it unpalatable, the subtle changes as they occur with time, the not so subtle, the words that define the emotions of millions of listeners around the world, and the instrumentation that guides through each turn. As an instrumentalist, I have been playing guitar since the age of 10, and over the course of time have picked up bass guitar, drums, mandolin, ukulele, banjo, and piano, all in the pursuit of a wide tonal variety. As a writer I began writing songs at an indeterminable young age, continuing to this very day - supplementing with creative short stories and poetry, while studying the lyrics and instrumentation of a wide variety of musicians across the span of time.My extensive creative ability does not limit me to music, rather adds to my overall ability to create for those who may need it. Versatility is key, and crucial to any creative field. It is a goal of mine to constantly extend my knowledge of creative skills while continuing to put them to use for all who demand an exceptional touch.;John Kresse;November 4, 2016;13.0;October 23, 2016;0;~01dc69b0073f0fd515;0;4.6

And in the end, further comprehension of your target group leads to better results.

Though I may not have much professional experience to boast about, I do have years of schooling and academic experience still floating about fresh in my fledgling mind.  As I have no major career oriented accomplishments to advertise, and I am still in school, I am left with only myself as a hook, and so I shall attempt to bait it well. Writing has been a growing hobby of mine for the larger part of the past decade. This particular pursuit stems from a passion for the (often times infuriating) english language. I love being capable of creating worlds with the rearranging of twenty-four little letters, captivating the psyche of minds I may never meet outside of the written universe. If you'll let me, I'd like to use these talents to help you "talk" to people in this way, too. Though writing is, and always will be, my main passion, it is not my sole profession. When the ink runs dry, I also freelance as a video/audio transcriptionist, and have worked avidly through many acceptable online companies, the most prominent being Rev.com. I have worked tirelessly to expand my expertise in both fields, and pride myself on the accuracy and alacrity of my finished assignments. My schedule is incredibly flexible, and my hourly rate more so. I hope to hear from you soon!;Phoebe Stacey;March 10, 2016;10.0;October 14, 2015;1;~01ddf30b583d70ac2c;0;5.0

I am a freelance writer with three years of writing experience. Writing has always been my joy! I remember how I wrote short stories on a typewriter as a child, allowing my imagination to run wild -- playing in my mind as a movie in a video-player. Writing is my necessity for living as much as breathing, eating, and sleeping. If I don't write something...anything, I find myself going into a withdrawal, fidgeting, looking for something to write about. I love how words look on both paper and the computer screen,  their distinctive shapes, and the worlds they create. I have written both short stories and poetry during my spare time, developing and constantly improving my craft. I am prepared to supply my service to produce high-quality copywriting, technical writing, creative writing, PowerPoint, voice-acting, and articles.;Aaron Johnson;January 15, 2017;33.33;December 3, 2013;10;~0159b723d101d207bc;2;4.9854358759

I specialize in the editing and proofreading of academic papers, professional journal submissions and the writing of user guides and training materials. I have completed thesis editing/proofreading projects following these style guides: APA, Harvard, IEEE, and CMOS. I am a member of IEEE and have access to the full current style guide. I have a degree in Electronics Engineering with seven years experience as an in-house technical writer in the US  semiconductor industry. I would like to do more technical writing related to electronics and software development. I have used and have access to the following word processing tools: Open Office, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Office 2016, and Mac Pages. I am familiar with LaTex and FrameMaker also however I do not have access to them. Other software tools I have are Adobe Acrobat professional version so I can provide you with a secure, watermarked PDF version of your document. I am an intermediate user of Adobe Illustrator and a beginner with Adobe Photoshop. I also can create excellent MS Powerpoint presentations. I also have the Mac and Open Office versions of their presentation tools. I have some Masters level education. I always took advantage of employer educational benefits and took several masters level electronics classes from Oregon Graduate Institute. While working as a technical writer at Mentor Graphics, I took three Masters level courses on technical writing at Portland State University. Work Ethic:  I only submit bids for jobs that I have the skills to do.I do NOT do any writing or academic work that students should do for themselves. (I do edit/proofreading of the English however)Tests on this website: I really enjoy taking them! They are not easy. But they are useful in figuring out what one knows. I have chosen to leave those I do not pass such as UNIX. I have never done UNIX programming but I did install software on UNIX systems and if you open the test results you will see 100% on basic commands even though I did not do well on writing shell scripts and so on. The same with Instrumentation Electronics. I passed both the Analog 71% and 100% Transducer subsections of the test, and Optical Instrumentation, well there I scored not a single point the first time around. Second time around I passed it but only got 50% on Analog and less on the transducers. I also earned a TESOL certification. I taught ESL English for a year in Istanbul both to adults and children. I worked in the health care industry as a nurse from 1979 up until 1995 while I was working on my engineering degree.;Mary Tsolak;December 7, 2016;50.0;May 1, 2015;3;~019f242307234b72a0;26;5.0

During my university years, the last year of which was spent at Middlesex University in London with an Erasmus Scholarship, I have developed excellent writing skills in English at a proficiency level, which I was able to put into practice professionally while working as a freelancer here on the Odesk platform, writing articles, web content, editing and proofreading documents. From my additional work experience I can extrapolate a particular emphasis on customer service and working in a team, especially at my previous jobs, both in the United States and the United Kingdom. I have proven to be a flexible and adaptable person, willing to take initiative, particularly given my volunteer work as an editor on a TV review website at the age of seventeen. During this volunteering period, I have demonstrated working well of my own accord, with no supervision. Having successfully balanced my academic and professional commitments, I believe it showcases my strong skills in time management and activity coordination, of working well under pressure, as well as a willingness to take on responsibility. I speak Romanian and English fluently and, regarding the latter, I would like to insist upon my spoken and written capabilities. From the very beginning of my university degree, I showcased a near-native level of English, and I will attach a letter of recommendation from an American Fulbright Junior Lecturer that taught at my university during my first year as confirmation of that statement. Furthermore, the subsequent four months of living in the United States and the ten months spent in United Kingdom definitely provided me with a useful medium towards cultivating an even greater knowledge of English.;Marian C.;December 1, 2014;8.89;February 27, 2012;3;~01eefa4b03ae930f70;4;5.0

I have already compiled databases of food blogs for two clients. Those data bases were geared toward their individual needs. Both were cookbook authors, one promoting artisinal sodas and the other french cuisine. At present, I am working for Jaime Purviance who is head chef at Weber Grills. I test the website recipes that are sent out to over 500,000 subscribers each Friday. All recipe must adhere to Weber's standards and formatting. Meticulous editing is my specialty. As well I have developed recipes for Melissa's Produce, Driscoll Berries, Casa Noble Tequila and Nest Fresh Eggs to a name a few.On a lighter note - I grew up in New York City and started cooking in my Moms tiny Manhattan kitchen before I can remember. As her loyal steed, we produced cookies, homemade bread and any recipe that tickled our fancy from Gourmet Magazine. I was lucky to grow up on the Upper Westside during its resurgence of eclectic and trendy restaurants, while having Zabaars and Fairway Market at my fingertips.My love of cooking led me to a Bachelor of Science at Cornells School of Hotel Administration where I majored in Food and Beverage, with a minor in wines and food and wine pairing. I worked for a few years in the hotel industry but I ultimately missed the kitchen and compromised on corporate catering.You can view my work at www.virtuallyhomemade.com or www.lizhughesrecipetesting.com.I would love to work with you and your organization.;Elizabeth Hughes;April 20, 2015;16.67;January 8, 2013;0;~018377daf268dee02e;0;4.9932045626

You need to look at you traffic, opt-in rates, referrals, etc.TESTIMONIES FROM PREVIOUS UPWORK CLIENTS:"Alex is a great writer and produced some fine articles for me. He has a strong sense of the sales process. I'll hire him again""Alex did a great job understanding our niche and creating content that was not filled with fluff. This was extremely important as the content was for C-level executives.""Alex really impressed me by asking detailed questions before beginning the project. He also suggested several good blog titles and considered SEO implications. Delivery was on time and he made revisions quickly."WHY CLIENTS LOVE AND CHOSE ME:As a web copywriter, I have been able to produce above average opt-in rates, sales, and lead generation. (You can see in my portfolio on how I achieved a 42% email open rate -- 300% above industry average).I have been able to get these results because I take a different approach than most copywriters:1. I look at your entire online funnel. Sometimes, we can get a higher ROI by foucsing on a different part of your business.2. I take the time to DEEPLY understand your customer. I find out what keeps them awake until 3am in the morning, what they dream about, and their frustrations. 3. I use the EXACT language your audience uses (Hint: Men who workout would never say, "I want to fit into those high school jeans.").4. And more...If your copy doesn't catch your audience's attention, connect to them emotionally, and compel them to take action, then nothing else matters. Copy is the key to a successful online business.Imagine being able to double your sales with effective copywriting techniques. What would a 200% increase in your opt-in rate do for your bottom line?If you want content and copy that sells, converts, generates more leads, makes you look good, and gets your audience coming back for more, then hit the "Hire Me" button to invite me to your job posting.

As a Produced Screenwriter, sought after Ghostwriter and Published Author with over 30 years in the business, I can help you realize your creative dreams.http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4792720/?nmdp=1  If you have an idea for a great screenplay or the next best-selling novel..

I work with publishers and producers on a weekly basis and while the most important thing is to have a fantastic Book or Screenplay written.. no less important is getting that manuscript into the right hands at the right time - I can help you do that.Elance has recently merged with Upwork, but on Elance I had earned over $399,000. thousand dollars over a period of 13 years ghostwriting books, screenplays, treatments, queries, articles, E-books, and a number of other writing projects.

If you decide to self-publish, I can also assist you with that.  I've also worked with a number of publishers and clients with the development of their self-help, business and inspirational books both hardback and E-Books. I've ghostwritten a number of these books which are being used by Motivational and Inspirational Speakers, Real Estate Agents and Investment Gurus to either piggy-back their seminars, support an online website or compliment their speaking engagements or businesses. I am a full time screenwriter, ghostwriter, and author currently under contract with Cine del Sol Productions. I have a number of screenplays I've written for this producer including Jr. Stunt Academy.http://www.cinedelsolproductions.com/cinedelsolproductions.com/Movies.html I just finished up a short movie, "Love me Haiti" which is based on a true story. You can find this movie listed on the IMDB and if you plug in my name into the IMDB database, you can find more work I've done over the years.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnL73nvg1EQ&feature=player_embedded I also write adaptations both script to book and book to script. I work with publishers and agents on a regular basis.  I ghostwrite books for many of their famous and sometimes infamous clients, so I specialize in writing true stories, memoirs and autobiographies and don't worry.. I will sign a non-disclosure and confidentially agreement with you so everything we discuss stays between us.  I've also worked with a number of Agents and Producers developing treatments, outlines and screenplays. I've worked as a script doctor as well as a proofreader and editor, so my experience and working knowledge in the movie industry is vast. My latest novel, "The Seraphim" was published in 2014.

Congratulations! You have found him.During the past fifteen years since moving to SW France from the UK, six of my full length novels and a series of nine novellas have been published. They range from Historical Drama, Contemporary Political Thriller to Romance. They were published under my pen name Fran Connor. My ghostwriting credits include a series of four Regency Romances, a Contemporary Romance and a Contemporary Thriller. When I arrived in France I set up, with like minded friends, a French/British Theater company 'La Troupe d'Acteurs du Quercy' performing dual language Pantos and English plays. I wrote six productions. My screenplay portfolio contains seven full length scripts and one short. One is in preproduction in the UK. Two reached the finals in the Bluecat competitions. They include a WW2 Romance/Action, A Creature Feature, a swashbuckling Peninsular War script and Contemporary Romances.I only apply for work that I believe will interest me. Churning out pages for the sake of remuneration is anathema to me. I grew up in Lancashire then worked in Manchester, London and the South of England. During my time in the UK I traveled extensively and draw on those experiences for my writing. I've also traveled throughout Europe, the United States, Australia and the Caribbean. This gives me an added perspective for my work. An example of that is my novel 'Her Man in Havana'. I wrote it after visiting the island which inspired me to follow in the footsteps, much larger than mine, of Greene and Hemingway.If you require a quality job at a reasonable rate then please contact me to discuss your needs.;Francis Connor;February 23, 2017;30.0;December 5, 2011;2;~019c912812fbe8f047;6;4.980776045

HAVING RECENTLY COMPLETED MY FULL-TIME WORK FOR A LONG-TERM CLIENT  I am again free to serve YOU! This client discover me on Upwork before I could accumulate ,many others and now I hope you too will discover the many services I can offer you.IF SALES ARE CRITICAL TO YOUR COMPANY'S EXISTENCE, then trust your sales to an advertising and marketing wizard who can assure your profitable existence for years to come. That would be me :-)I do it all: Copy, art, design, marketing strategy, writing, video production, SEO, websites, email marketing, social media,  and P.R. Incidentally, I am also a nationally known songwriter and producer, as well as former recording artist.In that capacity, my marketing instincts elevated my band to the top echelon of U.S. rock bands. Later, as an entertainment columnist for a Jackson, MS weekly newspaper I continued to earn awards and kudos. My eulogy for John Lennon was personally selected by his widow, Yoko Ono, for inclusion in the first Spirit Foundation book "A Tribute to John Lennon."Landing my first ad agency job as a copywriter and broadcast producer in 1982, I went on to create hundreds of award-winning and sales-winning ad campaigns as a writer and creative director. I served every kind of client and project imaginable for the next 32 years in Jackson, Nashville, and across the country.Passion and emotional intensity are the hallmarks of my work. My writing is exciting, emotional, and motivational. My creative marketing concepts extend far beyond writing. For instance, I created the Dollar General Stores Literacy Foundation, which has directly inspired more than five million DG customers to earn GED certificates or learn how to read. That campaign earned a special Presidential Award (presented to Dollar General Chairman Cal Turner Jr. at the White House) and the Saturday Evening Post Benjamin Franklin Award.You will find here on Upwork many young copywriters raised on the Internet with not a clue about the timeless tried-and-true principles of direct response advertising and major ad agency creative processes. They are not well-grounded in old school masters.  Me? Well, long before the Internet was even dreamed of I was out there drawing customers to my clients. IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE!  I instinctively understand human motivation and the language of persuasion. I will put your company on top and ensure the success of your campaign.And if you are not thoroughly delighted with my work you don't have to pay me.

And more importantly am I going to listen and communicate clearly.Language may also be a concern of yours. I am a native English speaker who has previous experience working remotely, and know the communication issues with this type of online work.Affordability is also essential.  Check my rates and consider how much more "bang for the buck". The cheapest may not always be better.   I am trying to give you the best of both worlds.You also want enthusiasm.  Someone who really cares.  Someone who will put in research (on their own time!) and think before suggesting a solution. The worst thing is for you to hire the wrong person, lose time and money, only to have to begin again.  Of course, you also need practical skills.  I am someone who has over three (3) experience with interpreting technical data, developing custom tools for jobs and organizing plans, contacts, actions and data. I am  passionate about writing, researching and organizing thoughts into paper.So why am I here on Upworks?  It is my absolute dream to be able to earn a living working for others remotely so that I am also able to focus on my own writing.  I simply can't do that with a traditional job.  This means I can flex around YOUR schedule, work on a fixed price project or hourly, whatever suits you.  This also means I can work whatever time of day you would like.  I am not bound to US time.A business associate once told me you hire FIRST "for the person" and SECOND "for the skills".

I worked as a technical support specialist for a telecommunications company based in US. I am always commended for handling and resolving critical customer issues. I always meet aggressive deadlines. I always accomplish ambitious targets that are set by my client. I am frequently praised for being resourceful and innovative in creating alternative options for the customer. I go above and beyond my responsibility. I learned skills that are beyond my specialization. I resolve the issues that are out of my scope of specialization by following instructions from our knowledge based tools. I am good at time management which is why I always have the time to do other freelance jobs.I do other freelance jobs during my free time.My colleagues and my previous clients were satisfied with my flexibility and versatility. Whenever there are people looking for a freelancer, they immediately give my contact information. I worked as a freelancer in various fields. I worked as an English tutor for Koreans, Singaporeans and Chinese. I have an unorthodox but effective way of teaching my clients the English language. My clients already know some English and my job is to further enhance their English communication skills. Instead of just teaching grammar, I find interesting topics which could be the foundation of our healthy conversation. I also let them watch English shows they prefer before our conversation starts, so that we could talk about it during our lecture session. I am proud to say that this unorthodox way has always been effective to all my clients.I also worked as a chat support for the independent campus journalism page we created in college to distribute information about school related queries. I can attend to 10-15 people and answer all their school related questions and requests via facebook chat. We used the page not just to distribute information but to launch campaigns for specific student events. We catapulted constructive reforms in our university that everyone enjoys until today like our integrated online enrollment.I also worked as a researcher for various fields. A researcher needs to extract all the vital information from all the cluttered sources. I did a lot of proof reading from the extracted information as a researcher. I worked for several types of people as a researcher. I have worked for writers, professors, college students and more. I basically, do certain part of their work that needs fact finding, data mining, data analysis and proof reading. Personally, the most rewarding achievement as a researcher is to witness the final output of my contribution. I assist history professors to get all the perspective stories for a specific lecture. I help writers to provide them the gist of the detailed parts of what they are writing. I help students in their research paper when they are running out of time or when they are jammed from streamline work inefficiency. I save them time as a researcher. I am a think tank and people pay me for my furnished ideas. When my creative process is at its peak, I even create the main concept of the project. This is usually tested when people hire me for their thesis. They always end up astounded by my concepts that always stand up during thesis conventions.If you are looking for a freelancer who will work for you for a very long time, please consider my simple qualifications, and I will surprise you with what I can accomplish. I can do almost anything as long as I am given a reasonable amount of time learning about the details of my job. I am really planning to work at home so I could do more out of my time. I am looking forward doing business with you.;Vankroyd Bontia;June 26, 2014;4.44;April 19, 2014;0;~018bf4ab1e2aab34d0;3;5.0

When I work on content for my clients, I strive to provide them with the highest quality literature possible - I feel that there is nothing worse than reading an article that is full of spelling mistakes and glaringly obvious grammatical errors, not to mention plagiarism! I am currently saving to complete a proofreading course so that I will be able to "officially" add that skill to my repertoire.. for now, however, I spend my working hours writing quality content for clients both here and on other freelancing platforms - you will see from my feedback that my clients have been very pleased with the work I have completed for them.. I even have long-term clients who continue to hire me for more work.I am available to research and write content on a number of subjects including health, education, current affairs, history, science, philosophy, frugal living and parenting. I have a wide range of interests and love nothing more than delving into a subject to learn as much as possible about it, which is certainly a helpful quality when it comes to researching content for clients.I am a native British English speaker, living in the UK and I am fluent in both written and verbal English. I possess 8 GCSEs and 2 A-Levels, one in English Literature at grade B and one in Psychology at grade C.. I intend to start studying a part-time degree course next year with the Open University. I am not afraid to ask as many questions as I feel are necessary to help me ensure that I can provide high quality content that meets my client's specifications.Whilst I do try to ensure that I communicate regularly with my clients, in order to touch base or discuss the work, I do have children and, therefore, arrange my working hours around them. If I am not online during the day, I can usually be contacted urgently if need be because I do check my emails sporadically throughout the day and will reply as soon as possible if the query is urgent and cannot wait until I am next online. I know that my reliability when it comes to communication is one of the things my clients really like about me and the service that I provide.;Cassie R.;June 14, 2016;15.0;March 25, 2013;0;~015422485c0b0cbd7c;4;4.9698333694
