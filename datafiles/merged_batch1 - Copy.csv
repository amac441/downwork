I also will conduct research or interviews as necessary. I am available for writing and editing projects including brochures, books, web content, articles and more. Also will consider proofreading and intensive research projects. Service DescriptionWouldn't it be great to work with people who were truly passionate about what they were doing? Well, that's what you get when you work with me. No matter what I'm learning and writing about I always have fun, and this is why my writing stays fresh and original. I revolve my business around 4 Core Values:1. Honest Relationships2. Decisions Made With Integrity 3. Client Happiness4. My HappinessThis means that every decision that I make in my business must point to those four values. If it doesn't, then I don't do it. What does this mean for you? It means that when you work with me we'll have an honest, open relationship. I'll make decisions with integrity, and I make sure that both you and I are happy with what we're doing together. WHAT YOU GET WITH ME:I am professional and very easy to work with. I also practice the out-dated art of actually sticking to my deadlines. This is my full-time business so my clients ALWAYS come first with me. There is a reason why I have high score here, and it's because I provide excellent copy and excellent service. I'm very good at what I do,and my happy clients are proof of that. It's just good business sense! I do a good job and get repeat clients. You're happy with my service because I'm quick, and happy with the copy because it is exactly what you're looking for. Doesn't take a rocket scientist, right?MY BUSINESS:I am NOT a large firm with a team of writers, which means when you purchase services with The Full Story, you deal directly with me. I am always available should you have questions or concerns, even after regular business hours. I run my business with honesty and integrity. You will ALWAYS get 100% original copy with me. I never ""cut and paste"" or plagiarize in any other way. This is definitely a hot button issue with me. I know other writers do it but I DON'T. My focus is on HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, not junk! You will never have to hire someone else to ""fix"" my work, so if you want it done right the first time then I'm your gal. Sure, you could go with a cheaper writer and then have to hire someone like me to clean it up 2 days before deadline because the copy is terrible and the statistics are all wrong. But life is stressful enough already, so why do that to yourself?Also, I will never leave you hanging on a project. Ever. I've heard horror stories from my previous clients and yes, I take them personally. Again, I know some writers do this but I am not one of them.MY GUARANTEE:I offer all my clients a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If you're not happy with the project, and we can't fix it together, I'll refund your money.
