I believe that the best examples of writings are those which not only engage the reader but educate them as well. A truly talented writer, such as myself, has the ability to cloak valuable information in a veil of entertaining prose in a way that allows the reader to take away something after reading. I have always had a passion for writing throughout my youth I wrote for my own enjoyment. However, it wasn't until leaving the Marine Corps and entering college that I decided to combine these two desires of writing and traveling and formulated a new path in life. I left college after two years and decided to take a leap of faith and become this new type of professional known as a digital nomad. I first moved to Bangkok, Thailand, from Atlanta, Georgia. I picked up a number of freelance jobs that are highlighted in my work history and thoroughly enjoyed exploring this new world of being a digital nomad. Soon after moving to Thailand, my hard work was noticed by a company in Beijing, China, who offered me a full time position as a lead contributor as well as social media manager. I had never been to China before but jumped on the opportunity. While at the company, Good Teacher's Union, I wrote on a variety of topics from travel writing, to current events, motivational pieces, and even did interviews both on and off camera. The experience I gained at this position allowed me to move to a position at Panda Guides, also headquartered in Beijing.In my most recent full-time position I was the editor-in-chief of a multinational group of freelance writers. I was responsible for every step of the writing process, curating article ideas, editing and layout to publishing of our daily stories. At the same time, I encouraged and challenged the writers to constantly produce quality work. I also contributed to the publication with my own writing on a daily basis. Being editor-in-chief has been absolutely vital to my development as a manager. Also, because we published seven days a week I have grown accustomed to meeting tight deadlines. Panda Guides enabled me to see readers' reaction first hand to the content we produced and narrow our focus to target expatriates in China. The ability to take a hands on approach and be so intimately intertwined with the full life of the stories has given me a deeper appreciation for my field of work and has rounded out my abilities beyond simply writing. After a year and 40,000 new subscribers I decided to leave the company to broaden my portfolio and also return to college as an Engineering student.In all, I have written creative stories for my personal enjoyment, research intensive pieces about politics, policies, and new trends, technical pieces on how to use software and technology, travel pieces about places I have visited and some I have not, motivational articles, pieces aimed purely at entertaining, as well as current events.Let's face it, in today's fast paced society centered around the internet, people gravitate toward catchy titles and hot topics that grab their attention. People have a tendency to avoid boring or uninspiring pieces of work done in mediocrity. It is, therefore, the mission of dedicated writers to attempt to use these facts in a way that benefits our clients while still providing quality content. That is the aim of every project I take on. Every piece I produce is well edited and polished and is delivered to you ready to publish. So if you're looking for a writer experienced in a range of writing styles and goals as well as someone savvy in the way readers consume content and has the ability to use it to your advantage then I'm your man.

I hold a First Class Honours Degree in Multimedia Journalism from the University of Salford, and am presently studying towards a TEFL qualification. I have worked in retail, content management and editing, marketing and more recently secondary education.I started my career in education as a Cover Supervisor at Outwood Academy Acklam in 2015, where I was required to cover lessons ranging from Maths and English, right through to a three month period in P.E and other subjects like History, Art and Science. A predominant part of my role was behaviour management and keeping the students on track in the absence of their regular teacher. During this year, I taught KS3-KS4 lessons across a range of subjects, and also one-to-one tuition, EAL intervention and assisting classroom teachers when I wasnt required to cover full classes. I believe my year as a Cover Supervisor cemented my classroom management skills in terms of pace, stretching and challenging and managing behaviour in preparation for my year as a trainee English teacher. With regards to my current role, I am training to be an English teacher with Outwood Institute of Education and Sheffield Hallam University. In my first placement school I taught a low level Literacy nurture group which involved delivering lessons to nine year seven students with complex needs - mental, social/emotional and physical, right through to a group of six year 11 GCSE Option English students, year 11 Media and assisting with the delivery and planning of year 12 English Language and Literature. In my current placement school I teach a similar range, which now includes year 11 EAL intervention with Romanian and Persian students, year 10 high ability, year seven high ability, year seven low ability and an accelerated reading group. Writing Experience:My role as an Account Executive involved managing the marketing of a number of client accounts. From heading up their social media pages, to writing blog content, PR articles and maximising website content using SEO, a lot of this job demanded a certain level of organisation, adaptability and creativity. After university I immediately went into a role in content management at The Hut Group. My role involved managing the health and beauty websites from an SEO perspective, which included writing social media and blog content, liaising with health and beauty bloggers, launching and running media campaigns and analysing SEO traffic to my assigned sites. Again, a lot of this role involved good organisation and time management skills as well as an eye for creativity and analysing. Whilst at university I was Website Editor for the universitys online news outlet Quays News. My role involved managing a small pool of student journalists, editing their news stories so that they were appropriate to go live on the website, researching stories for the web and writing my own articles.

Also will consider proofreading and intensive research projects. Service DescriptionWouldn't it be great to work with people who were truly passionate about what they were doing? Well, that's what you get when you work with me. No matter what I'm learning and writing about I always have fun, and this is why my writing stays fresh and original. I revolve my business around 4 Core Values:1. Honest Relationships2. Decisions Made With Integrity 3. Client Happiness4. My HappinessThis means that every decision that I make in my business must point to those four values. If it doesn't, then I don't do it. What does this mean for you? It means that when you work with me we'll have an honest, open relationship. I'll make decisions with integrity, and I make sure that both you and I are happy with what we're doing together. WHAT YOU GET WITH ME:I am professional and very easy to work with. I also practice the out-dated art of actually sticking to my deadlines. This is my full-time business so my clients ALWAYS come first with me. There is a reason why I have high score here, and it's because I provide excellent copy and excellent service. I'm very good at what I do,and my happy clients are proof of that. It's just good business sense! I do a good job and get repeat clients. You're happy with my service because I'm quick, and happy with the copy because it is exactly what you're looking for. Doesn't take a rocket scientist, right?MY BUSINESS:I am NOT a large firm with a team of writers, which means when you purchase services with The Full Story, you deal directly with me. I am always available should you have questions or concerns, even after regular business hours. I run my business with honesty and integrity. You will ALWAYS get 100% original copy with me. I never ""cut and paste"" or plagiarize in any other way. This is definitely a hot button issue with me. I know other writers do it but I DON'T. My focus is on HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, not junk! You will never have to hire someone else to ""fix"" my work, so if you want it done right the first time then I'm your gal. Sure, you could go with a cheaper writer and then have to hire someone like me to clean it up 2 days before deadline because the copy is terrible and the statistics are all wrong. But life is stressful enough already, so why do that to yourself?Also, I will never leave you hanging on a project. Ever. I've heard horror stories from my previous clients and yes, I take them personally. Again, I know some writers do this but I am not one of them.MY GUARANTEE:I offer all my clients a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If you're not happy with the project, and we can't fix it together, I'll refund your money.

I'm new to the Upwork community, but I've been studying, teaching and writing for 13 years. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Counseling/Psychology, and my Master's in Early Childhood Education. I am certified to teach Early Childhood through Fourth Grade in Texas, and have my ESL (English as a Second Language) and Advanced Academics (GT) certifications. I've been teaching in public elementary schools for 13 years. I have also conducted workshops for my colleagues, volunteers in local non-profit organizations/churches, and taught at an area community college. Earlier in my teaching career, while I took a year off from teaching to finish working on my Master's degree, I worked in a University as a marketing writer. My strengths in that job included my ability to interview anyone and be able to find something interesting write about (my boss at the time actually said I could interview a tree and make the story into a good read, but he may have been exaggerating), and my attention to detail. In every job, my desire is to be precise and finish in a timely manner, while still exuding creativity.  I enjoy remaking the mundane by giving it a new identity as something interesting.Learning is a passion of mine, and I love to investigate new avenues of information. I have always learned efficiently by reading and assimilating content on my own rather than listening to lectures, so I am an excellent candidate for any assignment that requires comprehension, absorption, and dissemination of information, regardless of my familiarity with the topic. Among friends, colleagues and students, I've always been known as a hard worker, for being articulate, and for always coming up with something witty when things get tough.

During these last three years I've also been working on a personal project of mine: A science fiction novel. I favor to write creatively and prefer projects that allow me to do so. I am able to write short stories, fiction, and nonfiction pieces. I can also create outlines, write chapters based on an outline you created, or edit and proofread a narrative you have already written. Flexible with my schedule, I always take the necessary time to write quality content in your desired format and deliver it to you prior to a specified deadline. In addition, I will make sure that the article, blog, or academic paper is clear of any grammatical errors. I intend to work with you as we both determine what you want out of your project and how I can help you achieve this goal. My priority is that you are pleased with the assistance and the work that I provide.

I am also knowledgeable about wildlife from growing up in rural areas of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Monterey County California. I am confident that these skills will contribute to content in multiple areas of interest. I have written papers on various subjects to include animals, community events, bioethics, medical ethics, biomedical research history, original biomedical research, and American Indian history. I am also willing to write and edit medical, biomedical, scientific, and historical content. I graduated top of my class.

Also, I have been editing articles and books in addition to writing feature, web content, and blog articles as well as web copy for five years now. Also, I am a professional fly fishing instructor and guide as well as a professional hunting guide and, I own two web sites.. one called Harper Creek Fly Fishing Company which showcases my fly fishing guide and instruction service and the other called Do It Yourself Deer Food Plots which provides information on planting deer food plots. Plus, I am an avid outdoorsman and thus, I have considerable expertise in hunting, fishing, firearms, reloading, archery, knives, wilderness survival, urban survival/prepping, herbal medicine, and kayaking and, I have written extensively about each of these subjects. Therefore, not only am I intimately familiar with the outdoor lifestyle, I thoroughly enjoy writing about it.. especially when it allows me to pass my knowledge and experience along to others who find it useful!Concerning my qualifications as a writer, I am a professional outdoor writer and author and, I have been writing professionally for over four years now. Thus, I have I have written extensively about outdoor topics for other clients and I presently have over 1,500 articles to my credit  as well as eight books which I have published on Amazon on hunting, fishing, concealed carry, wilderness survival, forage foods and, herbal medicine as well as numerous fly fishing articles which I have published on my company web site.

Plus, I am familiar with WordPress.Concerning my qualifications as an editor, in addition the various professional editing jobs I've had as well as proofreading and editing my own books and articles, I was recently hired by a client at Kaizen Management as a Managing Editor to assemble and manage the team of writers who created the content that I determined for a new fishing web site and, of course, I was required to proofread and edit my writer's work. However, although, I have read many different types of education and information books, my fist love is science fiction and therefore, I have read nearly every book written by the masters of the genre such as Arthur C. Clarke, Robert. A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and, Frank Herbert. But, my absolute favorite genre is fantasy/adventure and, there again, I have read all of the books by all of the masters such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, and George R.R. Martin. Therefore, due to my love of these genres and my expertise as a hunter, fisherman, wilderness survivalist and, a practitioner of herbal medicine, I was more recently hired as a Copy/Line Editor to proofread and edit the post apocalypse survival novel titled Dark Retreat written by Grace Hamilton which is the first book in the EMP Lodge series and which is published on Amazon.Consequently, I am a highly experienced, professional, editor and thus, I can provide you with services ranging from a basic proofread and edit to, line and content editing to, structural and developmental editing.
