You need to look at you traffic, opt-in rates, referrals, etc.TESTIMONIES FROM PREVIOUS UPWORK CLIENTS:"Alex is a great writer and produced some fine articles for me. He has a strong sense of the sales process. I'll hire him again""Alex did a great job understanding our niche and creating content that was not filled with fluff. This was extremely important as the content was for C-level executives.""Alex really impressed me by asking detailed questions before beginning the project. He also suggested several good blog titles and considered SEO implications. Delivery was on time and he made revisions quickly."WHY CLIENTS LOVE AND CHOSE ME:As a web copywriter, I have been able to produce above average opt-in rates, sales, and lead generation. (You can see in my portfolio on how I achieved a 42% email open rate -- 300% above industry average).I have been able to get these results because I take a different approach than most copywriters:1. I look at your entire online funnel. Sometimes, we can get a higher ROI by foucsing on a different part of your business.2. I take the time to DEEPLY understand your customer. I find out what keeps them awake until 3am in the morning, what they dream about, and their frustrations. 3. I use the EXACT language your audience uses (Hint: Men who workout would never say, "I want to fit into those high school jeans.").4. And more...If your copy doesn't catch your audience's attention, connect to them emotionally, and compel them to take action, then nothing else matters. Copy is the key to a successful online business.Imagine being able to double your sales with effective copywriting techniques. What would a 200% increase in your opt-in rate do for your bottom line?If you want content and copy that sells, converts, generates more leads, makes you look good, and gets your audience coming back for more, then hit the "Hire Me" button to invite me to your job posting.

If you're serious about a project and need a consistent professional you can actually trust, then let's talk.If you need a full project built from scratch, have a project half-finished, need long or short-term maintenance, upgrades, feature enhancements, webmaster or CMS tasks, get in touch. I will walk through your project or responsibility with you and talk out your concerns and answer your questions. There are no hair on fire, hit the panic button scenarios when working with me. No drama. Everything I do is calculated and planned. The clique is true with me... work smarter, not harder. Finally, when it comes time to discuss finances, I am realistic. I quote for work on an individual basis and take into account a number of variables. You can be assured that I tailor my pricing to fit the unique project, level of responsibility and timeline. I am going to bid realistically based on my experience of your needs. I don't bid low just to generate business! I am selling value: my  knowledge, my expertise in the industry, my understanding of the problems that are involved, my ability to solve the problems that will inevitably come up, my complete cognizance of the tools, software and languages involved, and my availability to help the customer when needed.

After which I plan on starting my own Information Technology Consulting/Technician business. After graduating as Valedictorian from my high school, I pursued my bachelors in Computer Science at the University of the West Indies where I worked as a Computer Technician for a year.             After graduating with Honors, I worked as Technology Operating Officer at The Victoria Mutual Building Society for two years, where I also worked along with their Help Desk Team. My responsibilities varied from aiding users with technical problems, whether over the phone, by means of remote desktop software, or traveling to their location.  Other duties involved configuring machines (new and old to company standards), connecting and removing devices from the company network and troubleshooting errors experienced by all levels of users. I also helped in an island wide roll-out of new machines to improve island wide performance and security. I was also responsible for managing various applications being kept on the companys Storage Area Network. Though I am quite taken with technology on a whole, my particular interests are: Networking, Database Management (MYsql, SQL), Web Development, Application Software (Microsoft Office) and Hardware Repair.           During and after my time at the Victoria Mutual Building Society, I do free lance jobs. I offer repair services, consulting and web development. I am very efficient with my work, I perform great both in teams and alone, and my interpersonal and presentation skills are excellent. I strongly believe that unless a job is done within the agreed upon time frame with every specification being met and in great quality, then the job was done poorly. I work well under pressure and my time management and organizational skills help to ensure a timely, proper end result.;Joshua Bell;August 18, 2014;8.0;August 9, 2013;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01144b2f476d4dc2eb;6;5.0

I have already compiled databases of food blogs for two clients. Those data bases were geared toward their individual needs. Both were cookbook authors, one promoting artisinal sodas and the other french cuisine. At present, I am working for Jaime Purviance who is head chef at Weber Grills. I test the website recipes that are sent out to over 500,000 subscribers each Friday. All recipe must adhere to Weber's standards and formatting. Meticulous editing is my specialty. As well I have developed recipes for Melissa's Produce, Driscoll Berries, Casa Noble Tequila and Nest Fresh Eggs to a name a few.On a lighter note - I grew up in New York City and started cooking in my Moms tiny Manhattan kitchen before I can remember. As her loyal steed, we produced cookies, homemade bread and any recipe that tickled our fancy from Gourmet Magazine. I was lucky to grow up on the Upper Westside during its resurgence of eclectic and trendy restaurants, while having Zabaars and Fairway Market at my fingertips.My love of cooking led me to a Bachelor of Science at Cornells School of Hotel Administration where I majored in Food and Beverage, with a minor in wines and food and wine pairing.
