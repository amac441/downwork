I have been doing field works, case studies, and group discussions that required the collation of data and organized summary from multiple sources of information. I am confident that I can finish the work in the given amount of time. Aside from content writing, I underwent a one month training in search engine optimization and I learned how to write articles that can land on Googles top search page. As an example, I wrote an article about Tiffany Hwang of SNSD or Girls Generation. The writing task that was part of my paid on-the-job training last year 2016, was successful since my article claimed the second and third spot for about two weeks from the time of publication. I utilized the Search Engine Optimization method in order to do this. Even if Im not part of the company any more, my article is still viewed at present. I have also written numerous articles that gained thousands of views.Kindly search Tiffany Hwang scandal on Google and click on my article, titled SNSD Tiffany Removal from Sisters Slam Dunk Due to Japan Rising Sun Flag Scandal Confirmed. You can see that its still on the first page after seven months although its now in the fifth rank. It received 5,000+ clicks the last time I checked it and that was way back August last year (2016). The website that my previous employers are running is still gaining popularity and the four top ranks were claimed by major news websites around the world so landing the fifth spot in the long run is something significant. I graduated from one of the top universities in our country that is widely (not just nationally but also globally) recognized as a reputable research institution. My former professor is known as the first Filipina to obtain both a masters and doctorate degree in the fields of Social and Cultural Anthropology in Oxford. She really influenced me a lot when it comes to writing. I have written academic researches mainly about the fields of the Social Sciences and Humanities  Sociology, Anthropology, Psychology, Philosophy, and History. But I also do creative writing as a hobby. I can create attention-grabbing headlines too that is of course, useful in marketing. Writing as a passion enables me to submit any given work in a short amount of time!

Currently, I serve as a Special Education Instructional Assistant. My professional background is in Higher Education Residence Life, and assisting special needs and emotional support populations. My content has remained focused on the real-world modern-day application of ancient virtue-ethics philosophy. In the initial two years of this endeavor, my writing was kept largely to myself. I regularly scrutinized the material for accuracy, form, flow, and consistency. I could help no-one through my writing, I thought, if I were writing for show, did not research the subject and context properly, or failed to apply it myself.Once I was certain that my intentions in writing were appropriate, applicable to everyday life, and respected the subject matter, I began posting new material through a public group I created on the social media platform Facebook, ""Applying Stoicism."" The initial influx of members consisted of friends, coworkers, and family that were familiar with my work. I did very little advertising for the group until approximately a year into its life. Through word of mouth, the group expanded at a rate of 2-3 members per day from its relatively stable original population of 50. The rate of member applications increased to an average of 4-5 members per day following advertising in similarly-themed social media groups. The current member population stands at over 1,800 members and continues to expand daily.I have published two articles on applied virtue-ethics philosophy for modernstoicism.com - a site managed by therapists, professors, and authors that explores evidence-based approaches in benefiting from applied philosophy. In addition, I post freely-available weekly content of annotated pieces of my early writings on my website applyingstoicism.com, linked to Google+, Twitter, Patreon, and Facebook counterparts. As of this writing, 15 annotated pieces have been released. Other material includes compilations of a 14-week written workshop on applying virtue-ethics philosophy on a variety of subjects, and 68 pages of personally-written content posts from the beginning of the previously mentioned Facebook group, ordered by date.I am here to offer my writing skills to you, so that I might test and refine them, while improving the quality of life for you, your organization, and those it affects. I am unafraid of new or controversial subjects, constructive critique, or being held accountable. I pride myself on self-discipline, resilience, and following-through.

My strengths have always been in the creative writing field, but I do have plenty of experience when it comes to academic and professional writing. Creative writing is just my favorite. Whenever I find myself writing an academic paper, which usually tends to be a research paper, I am always extremely thorough in my research and writing. I want to make sure my point is put across in a way that anyone who reads it will be able to learn and understand from it. When it comes to business writing I make sure I also do thorough research and that I know everything there is to know about the subject I am presenting, especially should there be any questions put forth to me by management.I am currently attending university so that I will be able to receive my Bachelor's in English.

""Excellent work ethic kept me posted throughout. And happy with final articles too.""Very responsive and very responsible work!  The above testimonials (taken directly from my Upwork profile) prove that Daniel Adams can deliver those results to you.  Currently based in Taiwan, he's now writing press releases specializing in technology. He knows the difference between a good press release, and an awesome press release. When writing a press release he will spend the majority of his time on the headline. Why?People are busy. People will quickly skim through things (you are probably quickly skimming through this profile). Therefore, you need a headline that grabs their attention and makes them want to read the press release. If you don't have a good headline, no-one will read your press release.As someone who has worked with and written abouts press releases this is an area he knows. KNOWS WELL.When hiring him to complete a project he will ask a lot of questions, focusing on what your exact needs are, whom it is aimed at, the tone required, and what you want your audience to do after reading the work. The aim of this is to ensure the results are perfect for your needs. As you've probably noticed by now, he has the record, references and writing samples to back up my claims. Plus, because he needs your full confidence in order to produce the best results, He even offers a written, 100% money-back guarantee (see the ""Payment Terms"" section of my profile) to put your mind completely at ease.",Daniel A.,2017-03-02,30.0,"February 3, 2015",,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01f017998ef61c9978,3,4.9281227538,upworkResourceCSV_10k_3.csv,

Yet, spending four years in an Engineering College didn't push me towards a scientific and lucrative job, and I changed career paths to follow my love for writing. I have been writing ever since, at times as a hobby, and at other times just to pay the bills. But like they say, your treasure is where your heart lies. Therefore, even though it may not be as high-end as software development or web designer, it would always be my first and last love, and I would always love doing that.Therefore, due to this love for writing, I love taking up writing jobs as a blogger, content writer, eBook writer, business review writer, etc. I have written a lot of eBooks in a lot of non-fiction genres. The research is the most essential skill point while writing, which enables me to write about any topic, even the ones I know little about. Whenever I am working on writing a piece, whether 500 word article or a 10,000 word eBook, I make it essential to do a thorough research so everything is factually correct. Grammatical Accuracy and Plagiarism Free Content are a given. That said, even though I love writing as a hobby and a job, it does not mean I am not ambitious. Therefore, to go high in my career and be somewhere in my life where I am working my mind skills to the fullest, I also love taking jobs such as Project Management, Growth Expert, Business Plan Analysis, Social Media Marketer, and alike. My mind is just a bag of never ending ideas. These little ideas, along with problem solving skills, have helped my clients save a lot of money in their business, as well as overcome the hurdles coming along the way. Some clients heavily rely on the business steps suggested by me, which has led their business to grow exponentially. Other than that, I am very good at Social Media Marketing. Be it any platform like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or any other. The vast tools on which I have worked, and the research I have done in the field, have earned me the title of a Social Media Expert, and many clients have relied on me for their Social Media Growth. I can take up your social media following to any number you desire.My good approach skills to whatever I do, and Management skills enable be to work well with teams, as well as oversee them. I can easily manage large teams on a daily basis, track growth, see what we are lacking, and keep everyone motivated. i keep tracks and records of every member on my team, and what he/she would be doing on any current day at any current time.All these skills, aside from the sincerity I offer, have enabled me to get a lot of opportunities and earn a Top Rated badge in the short time I have been on Upwork. I have had a wonderful relationship with my past clients, and they have had a wonderful relationship with me (or so they say in the reviews). Some clients even ask me now and then about advice on problems related to their business, even after we have ended the contract happily. I love to help them out, and give them the tips they desire and I know about. I hope you find my skills a valuable addition to your business. I would love to work with you, and aim to be an asset to your company. And I can assure you would find my services as per your needs, or even beyond.If you have an offer to make, or just a simple inquiry, feel free to contact me. I don't mind giving you a quick and free guidance in the areas I can, if you need one.CheersRishab",Rishab Bansal,2017-02-28,30.0,"September 28, 2015",3,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~017aef69f2993a328d,3,4.9776414533,upworkResourceCSV_10k_0.csv,
