Three years ago, August 2013, I returned to Paris to continue my life story abroad. I enjoy writing silly poetry, fantasy stories, songs, and chronicling my life adventures on a blog, Soul-Ramblings of a Wandering Chanteuse.

That's how you'll grow your blog.TESTIMONIALS:""Was nice working with Matt. He worked quickly and put a lot of thought into the planning of my article.""I can tell you really live what you write about, which gives your writing even more value for me personally.NOT MANY BLOG WRITERS ARE ABLE TO PROVE RESULTS...My writing has attracted (and converted) millions of visitors to date (See my portfolio below for examples of posts I've written which sit on page 1 for major niche keywords):4,000,000 million visitors to date...20,000 email subscribers to my personal blog alone...And hundreds of customers converted from that blog content...During that time, I learned that you will not build a successful blog because:- You publish a few posts and then wait for the world to show up (this isn't enough)- You add a few keywords to those posts (the SEO landscape is more competitive than ever and you need a complete strategy that prioritizes PROVIDING VALUE to the visitor)- You crank out low-quality 500-word posts (this may have worked 10 years ago. It doesn't anymore- and neither am I about that)So, what does it take to attract and convert QUALITY visitors and ultimately build a successful blog?You need to create ENGAGING, ORIGINAL, and HIGH-VALUE content. That's the key.Many people think they can just publish a couple of posts, throw in a few keywords, and they'll magically attract an audience and sell loads of their product or service, but that's not the case.The reality is, hundreds of other sites are trying to attract that visitor too, so you need to stand out.How do you do that? By creating the most valuable content possible so they go with you, instead of someone else.This, more than keywords or silly tricks, is the #1 SEO factor in helping you rank on page 1 with Google. Imagine doubling your traffic (and CONVERSION) using the latest blog and content marketing techniques. How would that feel? That's the power of an effective blog content strategy.An effective blog strategy includes:1. Creating highly engaging and useful blog content that helps convert readers into paying customers2. Doing quality keyword research and optimizing for SEO so that your content is more visible in Google search results3. Writing original, well-researched articles that establish you as an authority in your niche4. And much more...I could go on. I live to create high-quality articles and blog writing.However, I'd rather start discussing your project...One more thing, though: I'm serious about creating HIGH-QUALITY blog articles and other content marketing that moves your business forward. So, if you're looking for something done cheap, low-quality then please look elsewhere.Otherwise, feel free to contact me using one of the buttons at the top of the page and I'll do my best to get back to you ASAP.Peace,Matt",Matt Valentine,2017-02-22,30.0,"November 11, 2015",7,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~016f5909bb1333da51,2,5.0

Currently, I serve as a Special Education Instructional Assistant. My professional background is in Higher Education Residence Life, and assisting special needs and emotional support populations. My content has remained focused on the real-world modern-day application of ancient virtue-ethics philosophy. In the initial two years of this endeavor, my writing was kept largely to myself. I regularly scrutinized the material for accuracy, form, flow, and consistency. I could help no-one through my writing, I thought, if I were writing for show, did not research the subject and context properly, or failed to apply it myself.Once I was certain that my intentions in writing were appropriate, applicable to everyday life, and respected the subject matter, I began posting new material through a public group I created on the social media platform Facebook, ""Applying Stoicism."" The initial influx of members consisted of friends, coworkers, and family that were familiar with my work. I did very little advertising for the group until approximately a year into its life. Through word of mouth, the group expanded at a rate of 2-3 members per day from its relatively stable original population of 50. The rate of member applications increased to an average of 4-5 members per day following advertising in similarly-themed social media groups. The current member population stands at over 1,800 members and continues to expand daily.I have published two articles on applied virtue-ethics philosophy for modernstoicism.com - a site managed by therapists, professors, and authors that explores evidence-based approaches in benefiting from applied philosophy. In addition, I post freely-available weekly content of annotated pieces of my early writings on my website applyingstoicism.com, linked to Google+, Twitter, Patreon, and Facebook counterparts. As of this writing, 15 annotated pieces have been released. Other material includes compilations of a 14-week written workshop on applying virtue-ethics philosophy on a variety of subjects, and 68 pages of personally-written content posts from the beginning of the previously mentioned Facebook group, ordered by date.I am here to offer my writing skills to you, so that I might test and refine them, while improving the quality of life for you, your organization, and those it affects. I am unafraid of new or controversial subjects, constructive critique, or being held accountable. I pride myself on self-discipline, resilience, and following-through.

Since moving, I have worked with three online journals: Off the Crossbar, Atletico Fans, and The Sports Blaze. My work with Atletico Fans earned me a guest spot on a BBC Radio Five Live episode about the 2016 Champions League final. I brainstorm with two teams of ten writers from all over the world, giving me many different perspectives on sports and journalism. The work has taught me how to manage my time wisely and work remotely with an enthusiastic group of editors and writers.During my time at Hamilton College, I worked as a color commentator and an opinion editor my college newspaper, the Spectator. As a color commentator, I came up with new segments and developed a rapport with my fellow commentators in order to provide the best analysis on each game. I also wrote and produced content for a soccer-themed talk radio show and blog called Off the Crossbar, broadcast on Hamilton's College 88.7 WHCL radio. As one of two opinion editors for my college newspaper, the Spectator, I managed over two hundred writers. I brainstormed ideas and ran meetings to discuss and select topics. In opinion, I reported on college debates, lectures, and changes in higher education policy. In sports, I covered the Hamilton mens soccer, mens and womens basketball and womens lacrosse teams. I also reported on the professional athletic careers of a few of Hamiltons recent graduates.My education at Hamilton College helped me develop the writing, editing, and time management skills necessary for a journalism position. As a Government major, I learned to write effectively while analyzing and critiquing the writing of others. I also developed the ability to manage multiple projects within my time as a student, a varsity rower, an editor of the Spectator and an active member of several clubs on campus.

You can demonstrate your knowledge to position yourself as an authority in your niche. Here is a question to ask yourself:Will you buy a $1,000 product from an unknown website?

A not-writing-guru who can come up with tour, destination or hotel descriptions that make readers want to book? A not-article-ninja who can deliver a research-backed piece on the pros and cons of using Botox for crow's feet and angry 11's?Well, hello!But I know what you're thinking: ""That's a ridiculous rate for someone living in the Third World!"" Well, you won't be the first one to doubt. (And no, we're no longer Third World either, but that requires a lengthy post.) World-class quality for cheap hourly rates is the biggest reason why plenty of article writing jobs are outsourced to countries like us. For a pittance, you expect to get 500 words of well-researched, non-plagiarized, grammatically flawless content because that's been the experience of so many clients that came before you (without telling you that it was actually hit-and-miss). If that's what you came here for, sorry, wrong number. I'm sure you'll find some other newcomer eager to earn their first five bucks in exchange for five stars. And to that I say, ""Good luck!"" I hope you don't go find another writer to rewrite a cheaper writer's work. That's a real pain and a financial drain.    You hadn't gone through the trouble and costs of putting up a website only to offer content copied and pasted from somewhere else, offering nothing revelatory or insightful or even helpful to your readers. You want website content that makes your readers trust your brand that they will happily buy your solutions to their problems without you being pushy or sleazy. Quality content that focuses on your readers' needs will do that for you.You understand that writing that kind of content doesn't come easy. (Otherwise, you would have done it yourself.) It takes planning, digging up facts, percolating, and more digging, to say nothing of actually putting down words and editing for spelling errors, comma splices, awkward transitions, subject-verb disagreements, incoherence...Well, you get the picture.If you are willing to invest in that kind of content, the return on your investment can be tremendous. Your readers will tweet quotes from your website.  They will click not just the like button but likely leave a comment, and then +1 it for all their friends, and their friends' friends, to see. I've been around this platform long enough to be able to claim that I've written content for several websites over the course of not just months but years, so I know that I must be doing something right.. otherwise, I would have been dropped like hot potato after just one article.And that's no tooting my own horn -  ""Cherry is a great writer! Written content was always original, insightful and in perfect English. Would definitely hire again.""""Exceeded my expectations again and again. Impeccable quality, creative and a pleasure to work with.""""Thanks for giving me consistent quality articles through out my projects, I'll hire you again.""Of course, I can send samples (that are not covered by NDA) for you to get a feel of my writing. If that doesn't convince you, you can take my writing service for a spin before making a huge commitment. It's a great way to find out if we are compatible. I understand there are many reasons why hiring cheaper writers makes more sense. Some websites could get by with ""fast food"" content, for which you pay fast food prices. I hope you don't own one of those websites, because you're missing out untold opportunities.You didn't spend time wading through mountains of writer profiles if you are not looking to capitalize on your content. I'm sure you want to make your website profitable, for which high-quality content is essential.

He took the information and ran with it. Not to mention all articles were done in record time""""I would recommend to anyone and I look forward to hiring him again.""THINK OF THE LAST TIME YOU WERE GUARANTEED SUCCESS.It probably hasn't happened in a while. When it comes to finding a trustworthy freelancer, it happens even less. Set aside the fact that, generally speaking, there is no guarantee of success.Dozens of fly-by-night companies offer ""money-back guarantees"" only to drop off of the face of the Earth when their product fails.The difference between the real dealers and the fakers is that the fakers never embrace the process. They have no opportunity for long-term relationships built on trust because they aren't committed.In my experience, there are four core principles every of every relationship:1. TRUST - is the result of consistency2. RESPECT - is the result of fairness3. LOYALTY - is the result of quality4. COMMUNICATION - ties it all togetherWithout consistent, measurable results, it is hard to trust in a person's ability to provide true value.Without fair expectations, you lose respect for a person.Without true value, there is no reason to be loyal to a relationship.And if we aren't communicating, the relationship might as well not even exist.These four principles apply to every human relationship on this planet. This includes significant others, business partnerships, client interactions, international alliances, and everything in between.When a prospective client reaches your web page, what values do you want them to FEEL?To put it another way - why do you buy a car?- To do your part saving the planet?- To have the wind in your face?- To get an adrenaline rush?- To experience a comfortable ride?Or do you buy a car because...- It is cheaper than another?- It is high-quality?- You want or need it?The correct answer is ""none of the above"". Even with trust, respect, and loyalty, poor communication will sink the entire ship.That is why it is crucial to clearly paint a picture for all of those missed opportunities, people who navigated to your website only to click away moments later.Without painting a picture to affect their EMOTIONS, they have no impulse to take action. We never buy a car just because it is cheap, the same way we don't buy a Ferrari just because it is high-quality. The reasons may vary from products and services, but they are always based out of emotions, leading to impulse decisions. It is only later when they rationalize their decision with logic.Copywriting is an art form of creating emotional connections and building relationships with clear communication, proving why a customer should TRUST, RESPECT, and be LOYAL to your company.There are several ways to guarantee this:- UNDERSTANDING the deepest desires, fears, and dreams will create a bond of TRUST- SCARCITY - When you tell customers about a small window of opportunity, they will RESPECT you for it.- SOCIAL PROOF - Testimonials serve two purposes - The first is to let prospective customers know they can trust you. Additionally, it develops LOYALTY. When you request the customer to provide an honest review, their words will come from the heart. Emotional connections you form are built on great COMMUNICATION. when a customer speaks from the heart, they will believe every word of it. This is called the ""preponderance of evidence"", i.e. ""seeing is believing"".What if the customer doesn't know what to look for?Then they can't see it.If you don't tell customers what to look for, what FEELINGS to experience, they won't be inclined to take action.They can't ""see"" how your product will make them feel. Emotions are the most unique selling point of all, because everyone defines them differently.Give them that opportunity to imagine how they will feel afer they've taken action.They will love you for it.I could go on for hours more about all the different ways you can effectively bolster your communication...But I would rather work to help you on your projects.I am only able to work a human amount of hours in a week, but if you need my help I am always available to talk.

She was no doubt the best freelancer I have worked with.""""Ms. Lohani, went above and beyond and gave me exceptional work for the job. I can not believe how thorough and thoughtful her work is. She clearly has pride of work. She knows what she's doing. She made sure to ask me questions when I was not clear/ or she wasn't clear on what I wanted. Honestly, she made me feel very important. I am grateful to have found her and for the excellent work she has given to me for my use! """"The best part is that, once you hire her, she will be there for you always, making edits in the documents even at the oddest of times."""" If you want your work to be of the highest quality and yet want it within the smallest of time frames, she is the one you need to HIRE!"" See, I believe the world needs more great and correct health, nutrition and food content . Not more of what's already out there...that's just noise. It is the same boring, reiterated content which is 90% of the times never fact checked.NOT MANY FOOD AND NUTRITION ARTICLES/ PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS ARE WILLING TO GUARANTEE RESULTS..Why?Because the world knows that what they are reading is NOTHING NEW. It is the same thing they read a few months ago on a different blog. http://lifehacker.com/why-theres-so-much-confusion-over-nutrition-and-fitness-1572870867 This article explains the status of the internet health industry and the sad part today is that the readers now know this status too. So if you are thinking that you will find success in this industry without any new creative idea then YOU ARE WRONG!!! A book on weight loss wont suffice. HOW WILL I HELP YOU?1. RESEARCH :   I will study the internet and then based on my previous and newly collected knowledge will suggest you a topic for a blog, a e-book, an article, THAT WILL SELL!!2. WRITING AND TONE :  It is important the reader connects to the author or the content, for which the tone has to be conversationalist. I would help you get the most professionally written articles in a conversationalist tone so that the READER READS IT !!3. TECHNICAL QUALITY :  Today's reader wants you to provide him with fact checked correct content. Hire someone who promises content that is from journals not other blog posts like most of the bloggers on internet do. 4. HITTING THE NERVE : If you ever thought that people do things based on reason, you were wrong. They do it because they emotionally connect with it. SO, I will ask from you the age bracket of people reading you and then write accordingly. There are many ways to connect with your customers emotionally. It's my specialty. Here are a few examples:  1. Understanding -- I mean DEEPLY understanding their burning pains, fears, hesitations, and dreams  2. Using their exact language to talk to them (e.g. women who go to gyms don't want to ""get ripped,"" and men who go to gyms don't want to ""get toned"")  3. Creating scarcity. If people have an unlimited amount of time to decide on a purchase, they'll literally take forever to do it. I'll help you craft a more urgent message that will move people to action SOONER rather than later (this works well for me too since I'm incredibly impatient when it comes to getting you results) I can continue on this endlessly, food and nutrition writing is what I eat, breathe and dream about. Feel free to contact me using one of the buttons at the top of the page, and I'll do my best to get back to you ASAP.

Masters of witty, quotable discourse. Visionaries of plots that are full of jaw-dropping twists and humorous-but-brilliant ideas. The ultimate scribes of ink slinging compositions. Unfortunately, very few people have that talent. Fortunately, I don't believe it matters. What does matter, you ask? Good question, you. What matters is having something to say. If you don't have something important or interesting to say, people will tune out no matter how you say it. Of course most people believe that they have something to say, and if (or when) that is true, there are some simple ways to convey that something to the reader. That is where I come in. I will take your wonderful piece of something to say, and make it read as wonderfully as you think it in your head. Through my years of writing or editing research papers, essays, business proposals, and short stories, I have developed some rules to live by. For instance, I eliminate virtually all fluff words. It is very important to just basically eliminate very unnecessary fluff words because they are very useless and sometimes very distracting occasionally. I also avoid rambling. Rambling can be a big problem for writers because they can't stop writing down whatever comes to them as they are writing and they continue on and on and sometimes they wish that they had never started writing to begin with because then maybe they wouldn't be living in their parent's basement and they would be able to have a functioning job in society that wouldn't cause them to cry a little every time they realize that they couldn't stop rambling about nonsensical rubbish. Another rule that has served me well is to not be redundant. I also don't like repeating myself. In addition, I avoid writing the same things over and over. In other words, I try and say something once instead of several times. So if you are looking for someone to help you write that inspiring and inspirational piece of literary art, sign me up.

I would hide in my room and think up plots and characters. I would transcribe my ideas, hoping one day they would be printed on paperback.

This role allowed me to utilize both creativity and administration.. a perfect medley for any editor in the making. Transforming the student body magazine into an online ""webzine"" was hard work, but one of my proudest accomplishments during those laid back college years.Because writing can be a difficult industry to break into, my past jobs have centered around administration. Since I never pictured my life cramped in an office cubicle, I saved money, quit and bought a one way flight to Thailand. My first backpacking trip allowed me more time to write and introduced me to the ocean. I became certified as a dive master and started my own travel blog to document my many adventures. When travel became a passion of mine, the doors to writing opened. With my travel blog, I learned about website design, search engine optimization, and how to write captivating content. Currently, I work in a Market Garden in Southern Alberta. I am knowledgeable about agriculture and gardening, and when I am not in the field, I am updating the website, boosting social media accounts, and writing content for the blog. Though I thought my past administrative jobs were a waste of time, I had something to learn from each of them. I have become proficient in excel and other accounting programs like JD Edwards. They taught me how to be organized and work efficiently. Most importantly, I refined my customer service skills.I want to write and am excited about gaining experience in freelance writing.",Kyla Steeves,2017-02-24,25.0,"June 14, 2016",2,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01965f101ce126d59b,1,5.0

Entertain.Inform. Educate. I'm one of the lucky few who's been able to parlay my passion into a career. Over two decades, I've been able to pursue diverse interests -- from investigations into child safety, to the discovery of rare species, to interviews with some of the most interesting music artists of my lifetime.But over those two decades, as I've accrued journalistic and managerial experience, and earned my MBA at Emory University's Goizueta Business School, I've realized I enjoy something just as much as storytelling: innovating new ways to deliver stories to target audiences in real time.At CNN over the past 18 years, I haven't just produced great content and taught writing classes to people across the company. During 13 years at CNN Newsource, the world's largest broadcast affiliate service, I also led the creation and evolution of an in-house production unit. I created a viral video product that helped the company convince a key affiliate group to renew its contract. And I spearheaded the editorial development of a morning programming initiative that changed our core product distribution to better meet client needs, and ensure an incoming revenue stream.A lot of great storytellers and content producers have little affinity for the business side of the business. And a lot of the business people have minimal editorial expertise. I'm immersed in both, and enjoy taking an entrepreneurial approach to storytelling.

Writing something as huge and intimidating as a novel usually begins with a first draft being written in a notepad, and then the second draft written on the computer. I have written over 30 short stories, writing a new one each week, which I then go over, and send the ones I like off to magazines for publication. Short stories usually come from a variety of sources, such as what i'm currently reading, something that's interesting, and usually attempting a new way to write the story. I have written and developed a boardgame, from the initial concept, through to rules, design, all the way through to the end. the success of the game was due to involvement with the client, which is vital if i'm going to create something that you're proud of. I've been involved with creating backstories for a video-game, and a card game, where I would develop these ideas into something broader, and fun. Working on projects that are interesting is important to me, and I do appreciate working for people who want a little help in creating something they love.  I have a degree in Biology, so I am familiar and comfortable with academic writing across general biology routes, but also: Animal Behaviour, Ecology, Molecular Genetics, and Epigenetics.

As with any languages, cultural nuance greatly changes a pieces of writing. I was born in Japan, relocated to United States at age 8. Experiencing both cultures allowed me to develop sense of understanding differences as well as similarities between the two countries.Having various work backgrounds allow me to reach out further in my competence. Since 2015, I have been living in Japan experiencing the present activities in the country such as the major increase in tourism. I have stepped foot in the tourism industry in Japan by writing for a Japanese company providing information to English speaking travelers. Previous to my work in Japan, I obtained my Bachelor's degree (B.B.A.) in International Business. I have a background in Market Research which allowed me to become advanced in using Microsoft Office Word and Excel, as well as creating surveys and gathering information. I give quick and accurate work using broad range of knowledge. I'm able to research information from both Japanese and English sources, provide Japanese - English translations, give Japanese - English fluent voice narrations, and write professional articles. Thank you for looking, and please feel free to contact me with anything that I could help with breaking barriers between the two languages or cultures.

During this time, I learned how to work within limited time frames, combining both theoretical concepts with empirical applications in an ambiance of good communication and teamwork, with the stamina required to deliver rigorous and useful analysis. On this regard, one of the projects that I have worked on was a thesis investigation on the hard power play between the United States and Japan during the first Obama Administration, in the frame of the U.S-Japanese Alliance which I designed and conducted. Alongside these investigation skills, I possess profound knowledge of international integration topics, geo-strategy and security issues, globalization, foreign policy, environmental issues, climate change, country and region specific topics, United Nations framework, historical and actuality issues. These skills are complemented with descriptive and analytic competences on the approach to international problematic, with theoretical and practical understanding of conflict resolution and formulation of programmes and projects. These set of skills helped me to endeavour on my working experience at the Permanent Mission of Colombia to the United Nations, Geneva. During this time, I worked closely with the diplomatic personnel of my country to deliver appropriate responses to shared issues in a multicultural and multidimensional environment.  Apart from these academic qualities, I consider that I possess personal and linguistic aptitudes that further highlight my profile. I not only have good inter-personal skills, but also manage a native level of Spanish, a fluency level of English and French, an intermediate level of Japanese and a basic level of Italian. I would also like to emphasis on the advance use of programs like Word, Excel, Power Point, WordPress, MailChimp and others. Which have helped me deliver various personal and professional projects like the creation of the site RoomNSWE, which I Co-own and manage.I hope my skills are ideal for the type of work you would like me to do.Have a wonderful day.Alfredo Jose Hoyos Bahamon.Master in International RelationsUniversity of Melbourne",Alfredo Hoyos,2017-02-21,10.0,"February 1, 2017",1,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01848b86514e688adf,1,0.0

The first one is that I do not primarily write for search engine robots. Instead, my writings are ultimately intent for human beings. The next important thing is that I do not work as a ghostwriter. If you are looking for a ghostwriter, then go somewhere else because I expect my clients to appreciate my effort by giving me a proper attribution.As I previously said, each business requires a different approach strategy. With this in mind, I rarely send samples. Instead, I prefer providing the first article free of charge.

My studies focused on long-form journalistic pieces. I had multiple reporting stories air on the campus news station and was published in the alumni magazine. My strength lies in creative writing that is based in fact. Below, you will find an educational blog post I created not long ago. The piece focuses on the current state of The Great Barrier Reef and what is being done to combat the environmental issues facing our planet. Sample:Its no surprise that global warming is starting to have a noticeable impact on our way of life. According to Vice, my generation (millennials) will lose close to $9 trillion over the course of our lives. Now I don't know about you, but as a 23-year-old living in New York City, $9 trillion sounds like a lot of money I cant afford to lose. With natural disasters like the Louisiana flooding or the magnitude 5.5 earthquake that struck the central region of Italy last week becoming more and more common, what are we as the upcoming leaders of this world supposed to do?Previous generations have focused all their energy and funds to industrialization. How can we make this product cheaper and faster than our competitors? This mindset has lead to overuse of our natural resources. Take The Great Barrier Reef for example. This reef has been thriving and evolving off the coast of Queensland for more than 500,000 years (although the current formation is between 6,000-8,000 years old). The GBR has seen radical environmental changes over the course of its life. It has seen a cold but dry climate, a rapid warmth, warm and moist climate and everything in-between. These climate shifts undoubtably caused major changes in the reef, but without human interference, it had time to adapt and heal. With the human presence so prominent the GBR may have suffered lasting damage. In an article published by the Huffington Post in May of this year, conveyor of the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce and scientist responsible for conducting aerial surveys of the reef Terry Hughes, said this is the third time in 18 years that the Great Barrier Reef has experienced mass bleaching due toglobal warming, and the current event is much more extreme than weve measured before,. Hughes attributes this radical change to an unusually strong El Nino .Coral bleaching is not the only concern at hand when it comes to the GBR. A blog post published on the Union of Concerned Scientists website by Adam Markham, the Deputy Director of the Climate and Energy Program at UCS, states that the reef, which gained status as a World Heritage Site in 1981, is home to at least 400 species of hard coral, 150 species of soft coral and sea fans, 1600 different species of aquatic life and 2900 individual reefs. Obviously the climate change does not only impact the coral, but the lives of every single organism that calls the GBR home.With the damage to the reef greater than ever, you would think that the Australian government would be focused on preserving this natural wonder. According to a lengthy report commissioned by the Queensland Government, it will take $6.3 billion (8.2 billion Australian dollars) over the next ten years to save the reef (This has also been accompanied by some opposition). Most of the money will be allocated to reducing runoff from the Fitzroy Basin by up to 50% by 2025, this according to an article published by the Huffington Post earlier this month. Since El Nino is not only affecting the GBR, other nations have taken action in preserving their oceans resources.",Courtney Citro,2017-02-13,20.0,"October 25, 2016",0,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~013abf969d4c700525,0,0.0

Thats the formula for a good, passionate writer.  A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME:I write content, blog articles, and self-publish e-books. But, what I do isnt as important as what I can do for you. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?Youll get compelling and original content. Everything is well-researched, edited and proofread by an experienced native English speaker. Articles are engaging and easy-to-read. Projects are always delivered before deadlines and are ready to use. Grammarly and Hemingway App catch those stubborn errors and increase readability. SEO or Social Marketing? No problem. You tell me. Ill deliver. And if its not quite what you want, well talk and then you do get what you want. WHAT MAKES ME DIFFERENT?So many writers cant write well. Others dont care about quality and client satisfaction. Its sometimes hard to tell between the good and the bad. So, let me show you how Im different and what you can expect if you work with me: 	Authoritative content that sounds like an expert wrote it, which reflects positively on the website its posted on. 	Youll never have to worry if the content is 100% accurate.  Research is always from at least five or six, reliable, high-authority sources (not from Wikipedia or Social Media). 	Diversity. Content for a range of niche subjects, ghost-writing, editing and proofreading. 	Versatility. Do you need academic, conversational, satirical or any other voice you can think of? Tell me. Ill deliver. 	As a writer, small errors bug the hell out me! So, it goes without saying that everything will be written, structured and formatted to my own perfectionist standards.MY PROMISE:You dont need to worry about getting others to edit or proofread the content. It will be delivered in a way thats ready to use. Everything is original and always passes Copyscape. THE PROOF:Everybody needs proof. The links to my self-published books on Amazon and my personal travel blog are below in the portfolio section. REVIEWS:Still not sure? Take a look at these two snippets from recent employers: Sam has written for us over the last two years and his writing is both high quality and well researched. He follows directions extremely well and communicates quickly if needed.Sam does exactly what it says on the tin  weve had more than 300 articles, ranging from 500 to more than 2000 words from him and I cant remember any time we had a problem. Were a content marketing agency that specializes in SEO and link building in a variety of niches. MONEY BACK GUARANTEE:Hiring a writer for the first time is risky. Not with me. Youll get your money back if youre not 100% satisfied or feel I didnt deliver what I claim. CONTACT ME:Do you want a reliable writer to deliver authoritative content in a risk-free way? If yes, send a message and let me show you how I can help you and your business. ",Sam B.,2017-02-24,25.0,"February 18, 2016",4,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~0117e20196b729ce0e,7,4.9207726552

My goal is to provide well-written material for freelance articles, blog posts and social media accounts.  In 2015 I graduated from Ball State University with a bachelors in journalism with a double minor in women's studies and advertising. While pursuing my degree, I was a feature writer for the Ball State Daily News and was a part of a short-lived media group called Media Matters. While blogging for Media Matters, my concentration was to write articles about how the media has an impact on how gender and sexuality are viewed in today's society. And in 2014 I was lucky enough to receive an internship at Hope for Women Magazine where I organized the social media accounts that the magazine had as well as attending company meetings to discuss possible marketing ideas.   In June of 2016 I started reporting for Harbor Country News, a small town newspaper based out of Michigan City, Indiana and I am still a contributing writer today.  For this paper, I mostly cover local politics, grand openings of surrounding businesses and I occasionally take photos at high school sporting events.  I also worked as a layout designer at the Herald Palladium, a sister publication of Harbor Country News which is located in St. Joseph, Michigan. Today, I enjoy writing about politics and social issues as well as conducting movie and music reviews.  I also enjoy doing extensive research and analyzing documents.

I believe that the best examples of writings are those which not only engage the reader but educate them as well. A truly talented writer, such as myself, has the ability to cloak valuable information in a veil of entertaining prose in a way that allows the reader to take away something after reading. I have always had a passion for writing throughout my youth I wrote for my own enjoyment. However, it wasn't until leaving the Marine Corps and entering college that I decided to combine these two desires of writing and traveling and formulated a new path in life. I left college after two years and decided to take a leap of faith and become this new type of professional known as a digital nomad. I first moved to Bangkok, Thailand, from Atlanta, Georgia. I picked up a number of freelance jobs that are highlighted in my work history and thoroughly enjoyed exploring this new world of being a digital nomad. Soon after moving to Thailand, my hard work was noticed by a company in Beijing, China, who offered me a full time position as a lead contributor as well as social media manager. I had never been to China before but jumped on the opportunity. While at the company, Good Teacher's Union, I wrote on a variety of topics from travel writing, to current events, motivational pieces, and even did interviews both on and off camera. The experience I gained at this position allowed me to move to a position at Panda Guides, also headquartered in Beijing.In my most recent full-time position I was the editor-in-chief of a multinational group of freelance writers. I was responsible for every step of the writing process, curating article ideas, editing and layout to publishing of our daily stories. At the same time, I encouraged and challenged the writers to constantly produce quality work. I also contributed to the publication with my own writing on a daily basis. Being editor-in-chief has been absolutely vital to my development as a manager. Also, because we published seven days a week I have grown accustomed to meeting tight deadlines. Panda Guides enabled me to see readers' reaction first hand to the content we produced and narrow our focus to target expatriates in China. The ability to take a hands on approach and be so intimately intertwined with the full life of the stories has given me a deeper appreciation for my field of work and has rounded out my abilities beyond simply writing. After a year and 40,000 new subscribers I decided to leave the company to broaden my portfolio and also return to college as an Engineering student.In all, I have written creative stories for my personal enjoyment, research intensive pieces about politics, policies, and new trends, technical pieces on how to use software and technology, travel pieces about places I have visited and some I have not, motivational articles, pieces aimed purely at entertaining, as well as current events.Let's face it, in today's fast paced society centered around the internet, people gravitate toward catchy titles and hot topics that grab their attention. People have a tendency to avoid boring or uninspiring pieces of work done in mediocrity. It is, therefore, the mission of dedicated writers to attempt to use these facts in a way that benefits our clients while still providing quality content. That is the aim of every project I take on. Every piece I produce is well edited and polished and is delivered to you ready to publish. So if you're looking for a writer experienced in a range of writing styles and goals as well as someone savvy in the way readers consume content and has the ability to use it to your advantage then I'm your man.

Writing is part of me, its my second self. I knew this  for a long time, and it was probably the main  reason in choosing the university that I want to follow: Communication and Public Relations.  Im a dedicated, perseverant person, and I always like to check my work several times before publishing it. I think that this comes from my perfectionist character and its also a vital requirement in writing.	As it concerns my experience, I worked for an online student publication, well known in Romania as `IQool`, where I contributed with content for the site, being also in charge of the public image of the online magazine. Here I learned not only the secrets of dealing with Wordpress sites, but also how to do constant research on the interests of the target audience, so that I could know what kind of articles they want to read and why. This job has constantly stimulated my creativity too, because I had to approach all the needs of the clients and of the audience in a different manner, being able to deal with different kinds of situations and characters.	I have also been a writer for a magazine in my hometown, named `Wings`, where my main work included writing articles for teens, making reviews for the latest movies, or contributing with content on subjects like fashion, health, or culture. It was a good start for my career, considering the fact that this gave me power to participate on a national English article writing contest, where I won the second place.	On top of that, I have also worked for a student association named PRIME Romania, the only association of Communication and Public Relations in my country. Here I organized an event named `PR&Ad Fair`, the only fair of jobs and internships in Communication/ Journalism/ Public Relations in the country. I wrote articles for the blog, which included themes of main interest for the students in this domain, like the pros and cons of choosing a communication university, tips and advice for the beginners, tests and impressions on the related subjects.	As far as it concerns proofreading, this was also a part of my everyday work in all the places Ive been. I consider that something that its not evaluated and re-evaluated several times before it was created, its useless. Why? Because were humans, and we make mistakes. The good part is that we can find proper solutions to correct them. Theyre called proofreaders, and one of them is writing his overview right now, preparing to evaluate it over and over again, just to look proper and fine.

I have the education and background to deliver a variety of online business services, but I use Upwork mostly for writing. My writing services fall under two basic categories: web content and cover letters and resumes. WEB CONTENTWhile many people can write in a traditional, academic writing style, it takes a deep understanding of online marketing to write effective, attention grabbing content that will keep your visitors engaged. The average Internet user has an attention span of about 9 to 12 seconds. This means you only have 9 to 12 seconds to grab your visitors attention and convince them your site is worth exploring further.My web content is designed to convert and deliver the utmost value to your visitors. I make sure all of my web content is broken down in a way that is to the point, easy to read, and keeps the visitor engaged by providing valuable information that the reader cant resist.BLOG ARTICLESI tackle blogs in two general ways:Direct Sales and Service WebsitesI believe that blogs for product and service websites should not try to directly sell their products and services. We want to avoid sounding like a constant sales pitch. The point for this kind of blog is to provide tons of value and interesting things that your target market will want to read about. This way you keep them coming back to your page, and subconsciously your services or products are always in the back of their minds. Affiliate MarketingAffiliate marketing is a little different, but still follows the same principle of writing valuable and interesting information. The main difference is that these articles will be written about products and services.Article writing includes:- Market ResearchBefore I start writing for any site, I do market research and demographic analysis to understand the target market, what they want, where to find them, and what compels them to buy.- SEO Competitor Analysis and Keyword ResearchNot only do we want compelling information that your readers desire, we need to make sure that readers will be able to find the information. This requires analyzing your sites standing in the eyes of Google and finding the right keywords that will be able to rank your site on page 1.- Media Rich and UX DesignedA big part of keeping readers engaged is the way you visually present the information. My articles include conversion focused design layouts and media rich content. This means that articles will be displayed in an easy-to-read and appealing way as well as include pictures and videos that readers will love.COPYWRITINGCopywriting is another area of expertise. Through my time as a Contract Specialist, I gained invaluable knowledge of persuasive writing tactics that work. This has given me an advantage when it comes to writing sales copy. I have developed a very specific process for writing sales copy that is developed to target the mental triggers that compel readers to take action. What you Get- Market and Demographic AnalysisI provide deep market and demographic analysis to identify your markets pain points and find solutions to their problems. - Email Opt-in and Lead MagnetI help clients choose the best email marketing service such as Mailchimp, Aweber, Constant Contact, etc. I then creating email opt-in forms that are integrated with their chosen email marketing service.- Written-to-Convert Sales CopyAnd of course, high quality, written to convert sales copy. Based on market and demographic analysis I craft the most compelling conversion focused copy possible.RESUMES AND COVER LETTERSI write attention grabbing resumes and cover letters that are specifically tailored to your prospective employer. I have developed and tested a specific process for writing cover letters and resumes that incorporates principals from copywriting and web content writing.WORDPRESS PROFICIENTIn addition to my writing expertise, Im also WordPress proficient. While Im not an expert coder, I have the necessary skills to develop basic WordPress websites and manage them. I have been working with WordPress for 4 years now, both for personal projects as well as offering paid services. I have taken formal online training for front-end development, studied PHP at the WP Developers Club and have gained extensive hands-on experience with the back-end of WordPress, its template hierarchy, and creating custom template files. Get In ContactI take pride in my availability and quick response times. Easy to reach and always available, send me a message and I will get back to you within hours. Not sure if this is the right fit? Feel free to get in touch and tell me more about your projects and ideas. I offer flexible pricing based on your needs.

I love to write since I was a child: I was used to fill my notebooks with sport reports, plots for naturalistic documentaries and Tv series, mystery and detective stories. That passion had grown up with me, so I graduated in 2007 in Linguistics and Communication and I became a freelance journalist in 2009. I gained several and significant experiences as local radio and newspaper reporter and as press officer for public authorities and a sport association, even if my career hasn't been an obstacle free course. I also kept on creative writing: some of my novels have been awarded in national literary contests and I took part in a project of collective composition.I would like to offer you my skills and experience as blog & article writer, content & creative writer, copywriter: I don't want to sing my praises but I'm capable of working with care, precision, organisation, respect of the deadlines. Furthermore, I think the most powerful and satisfying aspect of a language lays inside its infinite possibilities to be modelled, in all its styles and registers. So let me find the best shape for your texts and documents!In sum, this is what I could guarantee you:- accuracy and precision: my experience as a journalist taught me to work on grammar to highlight the substance. When I compose a good text I increase your probability to obtain good results..- good organisation and communication: I hate to miss the target, the fundamental points of my way of working are to make a good plan, to be quick in answering and to meet the deadlines..- creativity for efficacy: I've never been scared of a blank page, why should I start now? Giving color and movements to the words doesn't make them just more attractive, but also effective and functional.I'm strongly motivated to give you my best: I want to build my reputation on quality, commitment and reliability and I'm sure that I will take care for your work even more than you!",Andrea Chiari,2017-02-22,20.0,"September 20, 2016",0,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~012bf746ab2e89f437,4,5.0

Alongside this skill I have a broad knowledge of poetic and old-fashioned writing forms, meaning that I can bring an authentic and very British flavour to any writing brief that requires a vintage flourish.I am confident in my ability to adapt my writing style to fit within the brief of my client and adopt an appropriate tone be it witty, serious, formal, academic, conversational, or simply factual. I have some experience in writing SEO-optimised copy and am able to provide examples to prospective clients. While I was educated to adhere to English spelling traditions I can easily adapt to incorporate American spelling and idioms where necessary.

The mightier-than-sword pen came a long way but, as is with everything in life, it was time for a changeI needed something faster. In came the Hermes 3000, an el-classico from my grandpa's collection.. a work of art, is what she was. That's where I learnt Touch Typing. Around the same timeanother wonder that would change our lives foreverwas gaining momentum: It was the Computer. I knew I had to make the switch.. else, I'd be left behind. These remains some of the few, yet important, changes that came about in my life. So there it was, I had a more-or-less of everything I liked: English, Writing/Typing & Computers. I used to write a lot of Essays mostly in my computer because it was fast and editing was so much easier. Back in school I used to be pretty good at Essay Writing.I picked up the ropes of transcribing out of necessity. It was the time of the Cassettes! CDs & MP3s were still a science fiction. I remember that moment. It was a perky-spring day in Darjeeling, the sun shone with all its valour, the sky was in its bluest-blue, the hills around.. all seemed to be making merry. I, for one, was in an adrenaline overdose. Why? Because I had saved the money needed to buy Guns N' Roses: Use Your Illusion I & II. When I actually had those two cassettes in my hand, I was catapulted into Cloud 9. I couldn't wait to reach home and blast my cassette player in the highest possible decibel. Things went fine except for one.. there were no lyrics. I quickly came up with an ideaI would transcribe audio to text on my computer. I transcribed Gun N' Roses in no time and moved on to The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Led Zep., Hendrix, Marley and the likes. Transcribing audio to text had grown on me by then. Writing.. however, still scores higher on my fondness index. I have been writing articles for a long time now and have also incorporated blog writing & creative writing into my genre. So if you need help writing essays.. I'm always there on the other side of the click.In a wayWriting & Transcribingonly comes as a natural combination to me. I have assimilated YouTube captioning & television captioning in my line of work alongside transcriptions and I also create subtitles for videos.I would like to believe that I am a conscientious person who is very particular about his work.. especially when it comes to English, punctuation, grammar, spellings, sentence construction, etcetera.

My rates depend upon the complexity of the project. Let me be upfront - if you are looking for someone to work at ""outsourcer rates"" or to provide any work that is unethical or ""black hat,"" then I am not that person. But if you are looking for a freelancer who will provide HIGH QUALITY and ORIGINAL work, completed by someone with both attention to detail and a creative mind, then that's me. I stand by all my work, and I won't work on anything that I wouldn't be proud to put my name on. I am fortunate to have a gift with writing and truly enjoy it. Over my lifetime, I have met many people with brilliant ideas and thoughts who struggle with getting them into writing in a way that effectively conveys the message. I have a passion for helping people take their thoughts and put words on paper so that the ideas can be shared with others. There is a great sense of satisfaction that I get when a client tells me thats exactly what I wanted to say! My portfolio has several examples of the different types of work that I have done for clients and I have others. [Note - if youre trying to view my actual website from my profile, Im in the process of changing hosting and doing a major overhaul, so site is temporarily unavailable.] One of my specialties is helping people develop well-written content that brings organic and natural traffic to their sites. I provide writing, editing and formatting services for online website content. Although I have not been formally hired as a writer until the past few years, I have an extensive writing, proofreading and editing history. I am conscientious and thorough in all that I do, often going above and beyond employer expectations. I have an inner passion for knowledge and answers. If I don't know something, want new information or want to learn how to do something, I do whatever is necessary to find the answers. My preferred jobs are advanced Research and Writing projects that require someone with great attention to detail and an analytical approach to finding information, not just ""collecting data."" {Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the data collection process, but typically simple research jobs don't pay equivalent to my experience & expertise.} Outside of freelance work as a writer, I provide business consulting, web design and online marketing services for small businesses, ""from one small business owner, to another."" As an entrepreneur who has been through the struggles of learning how to succeed when resources were limited, I understand what it is like to build a small business from the ground up. I have been a work-at-home dad since 2002 and absolutely love the freedom that being self employed provides. As a business consultant, it is my job to Research and Find Solutions for my clients, as well as finding information relevant for their business/industry. As a web/internet consultant, with knowledge of how content and keywords affect search engine results, I have a full understanding that there is ""much more to be found"" beyond the first Google results pages.Because I am completely self-employed, I have flexibility in the hours that I can provide, based upon what is required. I am located in the United States (Florida) and can be reached by email or if you are US based, we can talk by phone. Skype-chat is available if you are outside of the US.I am looking forward to work with you. James.

I'm a writer and editor who can provide you with exceptionally high-quality work across a wide range of writing needs.My background is in academia and then - for nearly the last five years - in the philanthropic sector. In my last job, I wrote hundreds of research reports on individual grants, contributed significantly to yearly summative evaluation reports that were shared with and shaped the lessons drawn from our work by the organization's Trustees, and wrote multiple newsletter-like summaries of the scientific research we funded. In addition, I've written web content for several companies in southern California and am currently devoting the majority of my time to personal writing projects (including a series of short stories and a long essay in which I'm trying to translate certain insights from the #BlackLivesMatter movement into terms that will resonate more readily with political conservatives). Also, in my last job I frequently edited others' writing, including other employees' whose work I oversaw.I bring the following strengths to all of my writing and editing projects:1. Can easily adopt whatever writing style or tone you prefer2. Always find the uniquely right angle for each piece3.

The aim was to get the kids off the streets and focus their intention on their own capabilities. We also taught them English and played a lot of games with them to socialize as a big group. I started to study a couple of things, but soon had to admit that study was not for me, for I am more of an autodidact and I believe no one can teach another how to walk. For a year I studied ""Liberal Arts and Sciences"" in Holland. It covered a broad area of subjects such as Social Sciences, Humanities, Business and Law. Thereafter I left to Budapest to start the study of medicine. First I began with pharmacy and a year later could switch over to medicine. During these 3 years of study, I have had a broad range of alternative healing experiences. So I started writing blogs, as to share my views. Recently I have also found a new family and these days I get to spend a lot of time with the two kids of my new-found love. Every day they inspire me with their infinite curiosity in life and now we want to build a life together as a family unit. I am a native German speaker, I am fluent in English and also speak and understand basic Spanish. Hungarian is the language that I am learning at the moment, which is quite a challenge as it is not comparable to any other language that I know of. I am very flexible as a worker. Last year in spring I spent 4 months living and working in Barcelona. I worked in a call center and was answering customer calls and emails. Creative work and also template-based working is manageable for me. Translation, Blog Writing, Article Writing, Medical Writing, Reviews etc. I am open for your job offers and hope to get some good opportunities to help you.

You've come to the right place.Im a freelance writer, comfortable with almost every conceivable form of writing: copy, blogs, features, creative stuff, you name it. I work alone, and so when hiring me for a project you knows that it will be I and my skills which you are hiring for the job and not those of a third party. Getting your point across is often about finding just the right words, about language that is precise and clear, without a whole lot of fluff. I love language. I love finding ways to engage readers with clean and simple words, using rhythm, punctuation and grammar instead of unnecessary padding that might cause the reader to stumble. A freelancer should always:         Be original  Approach your project with a unique flair catered to your needs.         Be professional  Deliver what was promised on time and within your budget.         Be a perfectionist  Craft your project with the upmost quality.         Communicate  Keep you informed on the status of your project with milestones and drafts.My method of working means that I am very flexible, can fit jobs in as needed and can adjust my workload to meet different priorities. This flexibility often involves evening and weekend work when a project requires it. I'm an extremely motivated, focused and hard working individual. With an inherent aptitude for creativity and expression, I thoroughly enjoy taking on new writing projects. My goal always is giving each project for everything, and delivering with as high a level of professionalism, perfection and attention to detail as possible, and (usually) well over and above my client's highest expectations.I am a UK-based independent freelance article writer, proofreader, copy-editor and website content writer, providing a range of editorial services and with a passion for the correct use of the English language. I am used to working to deadlines and tight budgets and do deliver what is required and when it is required. I am experienced in:         Copy-writing: Have written landing pages, sales letters and emails on web design, gaming, healthcare, real estate, finance & more.         Article writing: Good at writing blog posts or articles on tech, real estate, finance, travel & more.         Writing website copy: Clever at creating copy for home theater, email marketing, digital agency, hosting and other sorts of websites.         Copy-editing: Whether you're producing a website, a brochure or a book, clean, precise copy is essential. For me, copy needs to have everything extraneous stripped out, using rhythm, tone and punctuation rather than flowery words and metaphors.         Research: Having produced two theses, undergraduate and postgraduate, I am having shown myself capable of producing high quality research. My current research spans both the UK and the USA, involving research in archives, looking through newspapers and court records, conducting interviews and tracing persons.         Branding - Logos, brochures, corporate stationary and banners: A logo should say it all about your business. It should be individual, striking and encapsulate your brand.

Both disciplines consist of a basic framework, i.e. technique and design, that can be taught.. but neither will produce stellar results if their architect has no sense of the overall aesthetic involved. A writer or artist must love what they create... or their results will be flat and lifeless though technically precise.Proofreading and copyediting are natural extensions of writing, and I enjoy helping others combine meaning and style in order to  communicate their original messages. I can  tailor written work to reach its intended audience more effectively. I have a particular affinity for identifying and fixing errors in written content, and routinely find mistakes that others have missed. So far, my favorite example is when I found a sign in a bookstore directing customers to the stationary aisle. Artwork has always been a part of my life. The types of media I have worked with are too numerous to list, but it is safe to assume that if you can think of an art form, I have probably experimented with it at some point in time. I enjoy sketching or illustrating with pencil, charcoal, and colored chalk, and have recently been expanding into graphic arts. One of my favorite sculpting materials is polymer clay. I find it to be especially well-suited for jewelry and highly detailed scale miniatures. I also build assemblage sculptures out of reclaimed metal. Steampunk is probably my favorite genre, but I am comfortable working with many different styles and subject matters.Regardless of the project you seek help with, I will deliver professional results with quick turnaround.

This seems to precise, right? Well, that is because I am an organized person, which is also a great quality when it comes to writing. My passion for writing started in early ages and today there is nothing else that can overpower that passion. This exact passion gave me the idea to start working as a freelancer 4 years ago. As a freelancer I had the best experience because I was able to write in many different categories and topics and also for different audience. My experience is also stronger by being expert in word, excel, pages and iTunes producer. Also, I have basic knowledge of Photoshop skills that help me in creating killer book covers (850 book covers) and unique photos for articles as needed. I can manage working using both operating systems, MAC and Windows with ease. Practical, professional, productive, original, understanding and hard-working personality is what creates my unique and interesting work. Plus, my number one inspiration for this work is the ability to help people trough writing, and my easy to understand and energetic writing provides just that. So, if you are looking for someone that will understand exactly what you need, easy communication, unique content, on time delivery and writing that doesnt need editing, proofreading and formatting then I am right here to help you.

Yet, spending four years in an Engineering College didn't push me towards a scientific and lucrative job, and I changed career paths to follow my love for writing. I have been writing ever since, at times as a hobby, and at other times just to pay the bills. But like they say, your treasure is where your heart lies. Therefore, even though it may not be as high-end as software development or web designer, it would always be my first and last love, and I would always love doing that.Therefore, due to this love for writing, I love taking up writing jobs as a blogger, content writer, eBook writer, business review writer, etc. I have written a lot of eBooks in a lot of non-fiction genres. The research is the most essential skill point while writing, which enables me to write about any topic, even the ones I know little about. Whenever I am working on writing a piece, whether 500 word article or a 10,000 word eBook, I make it essential to do a thorough research so everything is factually correct. Grammatical Accuracy and Plagiarism Free Content are a given. That said, even though I love writing as a hobby and a job, it does not mean I am not ambitious. Therefore, to go high in my career and be somewhere in my life where I am working my mind skills to the fullest, I also love taking jobs such as Project Management, Growth Expert, Business Plan Analysis, Social Media Marketer, and alike. My mind is just a bag of never ending ideas. These little ideas, along with problem solving skills, have helped my clients save a lot of money in their business, as well as overcome the hurdles coming along the way. Some clients heavily rely on the business steps suggested by me, which has led their business to grow exponentially. Other than that, I am very good at Social Media Marketing. Be it any platform like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or any other. The vast tools on which I have worked, and the research I have done in the field, have earned me the title of a Social Media Expert, and many clients have relied on me for their Social Media Growth. I can take up your social media following to any number you desire.My good approach skills to whatever I do, and Management skills enable be to work well with teams, as well as oversee them. I can easily manage large teams on a daily basis, track growth, see what we are lacking, and keep everyone motivated. i keep tracks and records of every member on my team, and what he/she would be doing on any current day at any current time.All these skills, aside from the sincerity I offer, have enabled me to get a lot of opportunities and earn a Top Rated badge in the short time I have been on Upwork. I have had a wonderful relationship with my past clients, and they have had a wonderful relationship with me (or so they say in the reviews). Some clients even ask me now and then about advice on problems related to their business, even after we have ended the contract happily. I love to help them out, and give them the tips they desire and I know about. I hope you find my skills a valuable addition to your business. I would love to work with you, and aim to be an asset to your company. And I can assure you would find my services as per your needs, or even beyond.If you have an offer to make, or just a simple inquiry, feel free to contact me. I don't mind giving you a quick and free guidance in the areas I can, if you need one.CheersRishab",Rishab Bansal,2017-02-22,30.0,"September 28, 2015",3,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~017aef69f2993a328d,3,4.9776414533

Although relatively new to Upwork I have successfully completed a number of projects (please see my 5 star ratings) and am currently enjoying writing for US, UK and Canadian websites. I do not class writing as work, this is my passion and I am always on the look out for new and exciting projects and ways to improve my skills.  What can I bring to the party? * Great research, organisational and learning skills:I have past experience in the manufacturing / logistics industry and currently work in the education sector. Along with my work and my writing I have the key role of maintaining a happy and harmonious home for my family. All of this has given me the ability to be flexible and unsurprisingly I am able to manage my time very successfully!  Obsessively organised, I am accustomed to meeting deadlines and have a keen eye for detail. * Fabulous writing skills:Adept at utilising a variety of different style and tones,  I can deliver engaging, high-quality content based on the demands and objectives of your project. Be it with a corporate composition in mind or in a more casual manner. I am familiar with keyword placement and other SEO best practices and understand the need to provide informative copy with a well-thought soft sell. I believe that this, alongside my laudable grasp of grammar and command of the English language makes me a strong writer. *Broad interests and a curious mind:Along with writing and reading I have broad interests including fashion (particularly vintage), extensive travel, maintaining my well-being / spirituality (I am open-minded and like to try new things) and I particularly enjoy the espial of good food and wine.  Kept on my toes by my family and our lively, slightly naughty but thoroughly loveable Border Collie - Roy, we revel in long walks and the fresh air of the great outdoors. Who doesn't need space to think and take a minute or two to breath?*Passion and enthusiasm:With the time to finally follow my passion for writing, I am now looking to broaden my knowledge and hone my skills. In return I can offer diligence and abundant enthusiasm, with a view to meeting your requirements in an exacting manner. What I lack in formal experience I make up for in sheer tenacity and a willingness to please. I welcome the challenges that lie ahead.

It also entails great communication skills both orally and on paper.Because I work mostly on a freelance basis, it would mean that I should submit my work in a perfect state. Subsequently, this would sharpen my proof-reading and editing work as I am much my own editor. I do not leave much room for re-doing work as I thoroughly go through each piece before making my submission.I have managed to create a considerable work structure and clientle base locally. I write academic work for scholars working on dissertations, school projects and assignments. In turn this gives me an opportunity to study and get versed in many subject areas. I have developed much on my researching and acuteness of attention to detail. I have now managed to invade many offices thus can to a point claim variety to the scope of research and investigative work I may need to carry out.I am a versatile, creative and communicative writer and my greatest weakness is my drive to see every project through to the very end.

I am a big fan of Novel and Movie 'The Secret' 2006 which has drastically changed and shaped my mind to live, write and innovate the brilliant ideas for changing the entire lives of us Humans. Then after, I wrote my first book ''And Then the Planet would die insane"" which clearly narrates that the universe would stop working the day. In this book, the whole story revolves on one particular day that would definitely arrive when the end would be near and the universe would cry of enough pains what Humans are giving to nature and natural things. It is still a very interesting story which I never initiated to release though publically as it will lead to disclose the deep secrets and mystery of our lives. From thereafter, I been writing so many articles, stories and limitless blogs which have inspired me to give more shape to my writings. I indulged in technology, have become a tech geek and started writing tech blogs and has lucrated the SEO content. Thereby, I started working on making the quality content for various websites and have drastically changed the ways of website by taking them to top notch. The main concept I understood was how to work with SEO's (Search Engine Optimization) and deliver the best in hand written content for websites, blogs , articles and posts.Today, its been 6 Years of my deep learning and insights, that I been able to work and deliver the best of content in very short amount of time with leveraging to the luscious content for Business and individual clients.

I am new to upwork and am excited about the freelance opportunities that may arise! First off, I am disabled. I am looking for possible long term work from home opportunities that play to my strengths - which are listed below - and not my weaknesses. One of my weaknesses involves my cognitive speech. Because of this I prefer not to voice or video chat and prefer to conduct any discussions via chat. I know this can be an inconvenience so I appreciate anyone willing to work with me despite this. Please note: I am still able to read off of a script and have an interest in voice work. Now the good stuff: I have an Associate's Degree in journalism and five years newsroom experience as an editorial assistant. In this role I performed several duties: transcription, telephone interviews (this was before my disability), database entry, layout, uploading news stories to the blogs and researching and compiling data for news stories. This role taught me how to work in a strict deadline driven environment as well as bumped my typing ability up to 55WPM. While attaining my associate's degree I was also a tutor. During my role as a tutor I also assisted students with their resumes and cover letters. Specifically, I assisted them in sprucing up the wording and creating multiple resumes to coincide with the position they were applying to. For the last year I have assisted a brick and mortar store with their online presence which has included setting up, listing and maintaining a multitude of ecommerce sites and apps including: depop, mercari, etsy, poshmark and ebay. Each app contains on average 200-800 listings which I continue to manage. I also handle all of the shipments and customer inquiries. My true passion is research, data compiling and writing. I have a Bachelor's Degree in western cultural history which I jokingly refer to as a degree in research. Some of the areas of study I focused on were: women's studies, Native American studies, grant writing and museum studies. I also enjoy researching various topics on my own time and this has led me to research a multitude of interesting topics from wild foraging to the history of corsetry advertising in the Victorian era. No topic is too strange. I also have an extensive customer service background and while I can no longer take phone calls, I can assist in email and chat customer service inquiries. I look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your needs. ",Desiree Feigel,2017-02-18,13.0,"February 11, 2017",0,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~017abe84167dea428b,2,0.0

As a result, I am also completely fluent in German and able to translate all kinds of documents from German into English, having worked on projects ranging from art history dissertations to Christmas stories and picture books.Drawing upon my wealth of experience in the arts, music and entertainment industries besides having an in-depth understanding of alternative health practices along with environmental and political issues, I am able to tailor articles to the unique needs of individuals and companies. Having worked in extremely competitive fields my entire life, I have never failed to meet a deadline and love nothing more than a good challenge.As the initial producer of one of the most highly sought-after international bestsellers of the previous decade, I brought Paolo Coelhos ""Veronika Decides To Die,"" to Muse Productions in LA, the company behind such films as Sofia Coppolas ""The Virgin Suicides,"" Vincent Gallos ""Buffalo 66,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""Love Liza"" and ""Spun."" While working on this special project as well as other indie film projects from 2003 - 2008, I was writing very personalized letters introducing the project to the top agents, actors, directors and producers in Hollywood on a weekly basis besides bringing in the initial funding and tackling all the other rather multi-faceted responsibilities as producer. The film adaptation of ""Veronika Decides To Die"" was released in November 2009, starring Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jonathan Tucker, David Thewlis, Melissa Leo and Erika Christensen with a screenplay by Larry Gross. After the various film projects wrapped, I developed an original dramedy series perfect for primetime television in the imaginative visual style of ""Ugly Betty"" and in the structural manner of ""Six Feet Under"" and ""Entourage"" for children of all ages. Since 2013, my main focus has been on writing in general, including working on my memoirs and a book about my experiences with international matchmakers as well as dating in New York City, while living there again from 2007 - 2012.In 2016, I joined Flickr. My stream of nature and wildlife photos on there has turned into a carefully curated blog where I also write quite extensively about environmental issues besides weaving in important facts and figures about the local garden wildlife. I use different voices and styles for the backstories and usually upload a handful of images along with the appropriate backstories each week as they relate to my upcoming picture book series, which is based on my feathered and furry friends around my enchanted terrace.",Corinne Von Nordmann,2017-02-17,20.0,"February 12, 2017",0,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01d8cdeb7118287672,0,0.0

Since i was born in a  Portuguese speaking country, it makes me both fluent in Portuguese and English (as a result of my academic experience: 6 years in high school and 4 in university). Therefore I am an available for translating both English to Portuguese and vice-versa.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           One of my university required final project was to write a minimum of 100 pages writing field research thesis which was successfully graded. Another final project was to write a internship report. So one can realize that, writing its not just a hobby but a job.     What i like to the most is to translate. The languages i have experience with are as stated before English and Portuguese, and i usually do that for some local companies and for individuals.                  The most recent job was for, an American Anthropology, PhD Professor, who lectures at Kennesaw State University. The job, as one can imagine was to translate from English to Portuguese because the aforementioned Professor wanted to conduct a research, in my country, regarding the well being  of local people.

His job told him to choose between his career and his dying father...and he chose to be by his dad's side. Afterwards, he sought after his dream job, and I created a website for him. I wrote every single page, showcasing his talents, work history, and his character. It took some time, but he finally has the career he always wanted: a senior pastor. The church that hired him referenced the website as the driving force that caused them to reach out, and recognized that it was not only well-written, but accurate to who my father was. Just like for my dad's website, I write with purpose. I am professional and teachable, and can easily write reports and resumes, or pretty much anything you need, as long as I'm given the time to research it.

Fast, affordable, fluent (in English).Why should you hire me for your Upwork job? Six reasons (below). Im Alan Sharpe, direct response copywriter and copywriting trainer. I craft revenue-generating sales letters, postcards, self-mailers, brochures, websites and landing pages for firms large and small, in Canada, the United States and elsewhere.As a direct response pro, I write copy that generates a measurable return on investment (a positive one, I might add). I specialize in business to business copywriting.1. YOU ATTRACT PROSPECTSSince 1988, over 285 high-tech firms, advertising agencies, direct marketing agencies, non-profits, government departments, businesses and other organizations have retained my services to craft their promotional messages. Many of them found me on the Web, reviewed my credentials, then hired me without delay. You can, too.2. YOU GENERATE LEADSFirst, I learn how your sales representatives close a sale. Then, I work backwards to the initial contact or event that generates that sales lead. I then write your copy so that you sell the next stepwhich is usually to get a leadrather than close the sale. By collaborating with you, I create copy that is right for your situation, your goals, your target audience.3. YOU STAND OUTYour customers are busy. And easily distracted. Theyre bombarded with hundreds of marketing messages a day. Smartphones, tablets, laptops (hey, even people), compete for their limited attention. Thats why my copywriting services help you stand out with compelling copy and targeted messages.4. YOU INCREASE YOUR RESPONSE RATESDo you need to generate leads for your sales force, generate traffic at your trade show booth, drive buyers to your website, introduce new products and services to your customers? Whatever your goal, I craft a promotional piece that addresses your immediate business challenge.5. YOU CRAFT OFFERS THAT MOTIVATE BUYERSI work with your team to craft an offer that meets the eight requirements of all successful offers. A compelling offer is vital to the success of your direct response campaign. I have a good idea of what works, what fails, and what you need to do to craft an offer that generates the response (and conversion) that you need.6. YOU MOVE PROSPECTS ALONG YOUR PIPELINEI write the brochures, white papers, case studies, success stories and special industry reports that you give to prospects who respond to your lead generation piece. I also write customized landing pages that help you qualify prospects and take each one to the next step in your sales process.ABOUT MEI have taught direct response copywriting at the post-graduate level. I taught a 12-week course, Copywriting that Sells, at the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies. And I was invited for many years to teach a class on direct mail fundraising copywriting at Humber College. I teach highly rated copywriting courses at Udemy.Starting in 1988, I taught myself the craft of advertising copywriting, and worked as a freelance copywriter as well as a senior copywriter for two advertising agencies. I learned the craft of envelope teasers, Johnson boxes, buckslips and segmentations by writing direct mail packages for Apple, Bell Mobility, IBM, Computer Associates, Sun Microsystems and others. After working for a decade as a copywriter, I narrowed my focus to two specialties: writing direct mail letters for businesses, and fundraising letters for non-profits. My clients over the years have included Apple, IBM, Bell, Hilton Hotels, Amnesty International, Habitat for Humanity and Doctors Without Borders.For those who care to know, my copywriting advice appears in marketing textbooks and guides, including Canadian Marketing. 5th ed., Internet Marketing for Less than $500/Year, and Start and Run a Profitable Copywriting Business. I have written five books on copywriting: Breakthrough Fundraising Letters, Mail Superiority, Pushing the Envelope, Lucrative Donor Newsletters and Online Fundraising Secrets. I have co-authored a number of books, including two editions of The Canada Yearbook and two editions of Canada: A Portrait, one of which won awards across Canada.HIRE ME IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD A CHEAPER COPYWRITERMessage me through UpWork.

Sure writing and finishing a story or book is something that gives you immense personal satisfaction. But you also want to make money. To do that, you need to stand out. And with hundreds of new books going to market every day, that's getting harder and harder.How do you stand out? With a quality product. A product that's well crafted and readable. That's meticulously edited. That's properly formatted and professional-looking. That's expertly marketed.That's where I come in and help you with all of the above.Ghostwriting - You're looking for a writer that goes a little deeper, that doesn't just scratch the surface and offers a cut above all the average prose out there. You want writing that grabs the reader and holds onto them for dear life. This is true for fiction and non-fiction alike. I can give you that. Quality words. Your by-line. Editing - I know that finding a good editor can be tough. You want someone who foremost is a genuine lover of books and storytelling in general. You want someone who has an excellent command of the English language and knows the conventions of style. And you want someone who will work with you while respecting and helping to hone your unique voice as an author. These are the philosophies by which I live and work. If your masterpiece is already written, but you need another pair of loving, yet discerning eyes, to make your story and your writing that much better, get in touch.Formatting and Interior Design and Layout - Just because you publish independently doesn't mean your work has to show it. Smooth' clean layouts that are the hallmark of the traditional publishing industry but you can have them too. You want your book to look like a real book. You want a cover design that set your book apart and makes it look like a real contender in its genre. I can help with that too.Sales Descriptions and Marketing - A good book description is worth its weight in gold. You can have an excellent book, the best layout, an amazing cover, but if a reader isn't intrigued by your book description, they won't even see all of that. I can work with you to craft a description that will help boost your book sales. While I'm at it, I can also write you a rocking author bio (and build you a snazzy author website to match), produce a compelling book trailer, create a media kit for your book, and write you some brilliant press releases. I have a decade of experience in the publishing industry both traditional and independent and I am super passionate about helping both new and experienced authors and publishers better their work and their products. For Bloggers and Brands:Your website isnt just a website. Its your commitment to your cause--pixelized.Your website is where you bring your thing to life. It's where you provide information, inspiration, and entertainment, and it's where people from all over the world can show up and give you money.People will make split second decisions about your brand when first visiting your website, so it needs to be impressive.Your website is your first impression, and online where everyone's running around with ADD, when they land on your website, you want them to stay. And nobody's staying on a website that looks amateur, that's hard to read, or that doesn't look like you actually know what you're doing. You might have the most beautiful products (or services) inside, but if the outside doesn't look like a place that gets your customer excited, and simultaneously builds trust? Then the inside doesn't matter because no one will pay enough attention to look.And your message? The very heart of what you do? Your big why? Needs to be crystal clear.Whether youre selling a product, a service, a book, a concept, an idea or a message, everyones got something to sell. And in an increasingly digital world, that selling? Depends largely on words. Words that appear on your website. Words that appear in your tagline. Words that appear on your homepage. Words that appear in your opt-in. Words that appear in your write-ups. Words that ask people to do something. Words that ask people to buy something. Even if that something is just you and your ideas.What I do is help you get to the heart of who you are, what you do, what makes you unique, and what your message is. We then turn those facets into a brand story that is compelling, and above all, sellable. Then we take your story, your copy, and your design and bring them all into alignment so that the whole wide world can't help but notice.-A website that gets noticed and immediately establishes you as a professional-Copy that gets to the heart of why you do what you go and get's your audience to buy inNow that's a powerhouse brand.Feel free to reach out to me so we can talk more about your project and how I can help.",Desiree Moodie,2017-02-24,25.0,"July 20, 2007",0,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~012568bd85944ec325,3,4.8949518133

But as every good writer knows a second or even third set of eyes should be used to make your writing amazing.Although the grammar checking programs like Grammarly have come a long way to improving our writing skills, its still not the same as having that fresh set of eyes.  It doesnt have the ability as a human to catch those correctly spelt words that have the wrong meaning (at least all the time), or to register the nuances that the human brain will register.Do you want to make sure your work has a proper flow to it?That when your readers get into your book they wont be able to put it down?That you are put into the best view possible so your new readers cant wait to get into the next book you write?That you find a proofreader that you can work with now and in the future?You are the writer, and as such, it is an understanding that all works are yours, I will not stake any claim to it at all, consider me your ace in the hole. Does this sound like what you want for your works of art?If so, click on the nice big green button at the top of the screen and send me a message.Lets make your piece of writing a masterpiece.",Calyie Martin,2017-02-16,25.0,"November 9, 2015",4,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01a366afafcc018400,3,4.9943933843

Organization, research, and structure are essential as well, and are the building blocks on which the ideal words are built. Whether you are seeking just the right words to communicate a traditional medical procedure or alternative treatment to patients or medical professionals or you simply need your clinics literature (reports, Internet articles, brochures, etc.) edited for uniformity and clarity, making every word speak to your specific audience is my specialty.My first line of focus in every medical writing or editing project is to find out who your audience is. Is your audience the patient? Medical language can be very difficult and overwhelming for a patient to grasp, especially one who may have just learned he or she has a new medical condition. Theres a lot to sort out in these cases, and deciphering the language of medicine should not be an additional burden on the patient. Is your medical literature that you provide to the patient written at a fifth-grade level (this is the recommendation since the general population of patients does not have a background in medical terminology)? This is how I approach all medical writing and editing projects geared toward patientsI bridge that gap of understanding between medical professional and patient. Is your audience fellow medical professionals? I understand and can easily communicate the language of medicine among practitioners. I have a bachelor of science in health information administration and an associate of science in health information technology. My background is in health information administration as a director in large hospital and multi-hospital settings. As a director I communicated with physicians and other medical professionals on a daily basis for over a decade. In addition, I have the following experience:	Medical coding (ER, outpatient, inpatientICD-9, ICD-10, CPT)	Credentialed through the American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA)RHIA since 1996, RHIT from 1994 to 1996	Adjunct faculty at a community college for two years (taught medical coding, medical terminology, and medical transcription)	Director of health information administration, medical transcription, coding, and utilization managementI am also studying for the medical writing certification examination offered by the American Medical Writers Association (AMWA) and working toward my medical writer certified (MWC) credential. Sitting for this exam requires over four thousand hours working as a professional medical writer and editor. Areas specific to writing that I will focus on as I write or edit your medical project include the following:1. Taking a flat writing style and making it sharp2. Using proper punctuation to enhance sentence structure3. Correcting and streamlining grammar4. Assuring clarity of content5. Reviewing consistency and uniformity (per project and with the practices literature as a whole)6. Finding disruptions in rhythm and flow7. Discovering holes in the message and querying inaccuracies8. Eliminating unnecessary words or phrases9. Strengthening ideas10. Suggesting creative touches when appropriate (analogies, for example)As you consider me for your project, know that my passion is merging my experience in health information administration and teaching with my desire to make the language of medicine (both traditional and alternative) approachable for the patient and high quality for medical professionals.",Karen Aldridge,2017-02-24,27.5,"August 30, 2012",5,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01fe93db28c15274f5,3,4.9784832533

Once the target has been identified, the skilled writer selects an arrow that will hurtle through the air until it pierces the intended target.. compelling them to action, creating an emotion or educating them on a specific topic. No matter your need: from curriculum development to strategic plans, business journals to informative blog postings, when you want words to compel the reader in some way, I can help.  As a former school administrator, teacher and general manager of a retail store chain, my unique skill set will meet your specific need. When you want to blanket a target with arrows and aren't concerned with accuracy, choose any writer.  When you want to strike the heart of your reader, look no further.

I provide second to none customer service with personalized Workouts and Meal Plans, because I do not believe in a 'Cookie Cutter' approach.

He convinced me to change my diet and exercise right away and the results were quick. I lost 20 pounds in the first month and to this date I've lost 35 pounds going from 200 to 165 pounds. I am ecstatic at the progress so far and never really believed it could happen in the first place until I met Matt. This client was able to lower his dosage on some of his diabetes medication, and was even able to stop taking some as a whole.

My work as a student has been selected for publication as well as presentation at international conferences. As a research assistant I worked with professors and team members on projects in fields such as educational psychology and musical performance. I not only wrote researched and summarized articles, but collaborated with my clients on the structure, written content, editing of projects, as well as the writing of grant proposals. In my work on a multimedia project at McGill University's Schulich School of Music I was able to exercise more creativity in my writing, developing dynamic styles that would engage a wider community and help to promote the project. In addition to this work within academia I also completed an internship in the News Division of Aslan Media, which allowed me to gain experience writing for social media in the fields of news and politics. During this time I was able to quickly develop a network of resources to gain an indepth understanding of rapidly developing events.

I would love to have the opportunity to help you meet your goals while using the skills I've obtained in these areas. I'm new to the Upwork community, but I've been studying, teaching and writing for 13 years. I have a Bachelor's Degree in Counseling/Psychology, and my Master's in Early Childhood Education. I am certified to teach Early Childhood through Fourth Grade in Texas, and have my ESL (English as a Second Language) and Advanced Academics (GT) certifications. I've been teaching in public elementary schools for 13 years. I have also conducted workshops for my colleagues, volunteers in local non-profit organizations/churches, and taught at an area community college. Earlier in my teaching career, while I took a year off from teaching to finish working on my Master's degree, I worked in a University as a marketing writer. My strengths in that job included my ability to interview anyone and be able to find something interesting write about (my boss at the time actually said I could interview a tree and make the story into a good read, but he may have been exaggerating), and my attention to detail. In every job, my desire is to be precise and finish in a timely manner, while still exuding creativity.  I enjoy remaking the mundane by giving it a new identity as something interesting.Learning is a passion of mine, and I love to investigate new avenues of information. I have always learned efficiently by reading and assimilating content on my own rather than listening to lectures, so I am an excellent candidate for any assignment that requires comprehension, absorption, and dissemination of information, regardless of my familiarity with the topic. Among friends, colleagues and students, I've always been known as a hard worker, for being articulate, and for always coming up with something witty when things get tough.  I'm a voracious reader with an excellent command of grammar, vocabulary and syntax, but I can also hold (and enjoy) a solid conversation with four-year-olds any day of the week.Your needs will be my priority when I accept an assignment from you.

You are guaranteed a high standard of professionalism, attention to detail, and a dedication to get the job done right. I am sensitive to your changes as we go through the process and committed to getting your project done to the level of your satisfaction.Technical Writing, Proofreading & Editing  My 25 years of experience in technical writing honed my skills and understanding of this specific style of writing. When writing your technical manuals, if necessary, I have the 'universal understanding', but the 'kindergarten vocabulary' needed to make complex principals easily understood.  When proofreading and editing your technical manuals, misspellings, grammatical errors, and contextual errors are corrected while maintaining the integrity of the technical tone.  You will receive reliable, competent, and thorough work on all your projects. My commitment is to getting your project done the quickest, most efficient way possible, on time and within your budget.   Proofreading & Editing  Your materials will be professionally, meticulously, efficiently and rigorously proofread/edited with suggested changes highlighted in Microsoft Word using the Track Changes feature. By using Microsoft Words Track Changes feature (other options available), you are able to quickly and easily identify and accept proposed changes. I will also match your desired tone (technical, business, academic, conversational) or a combination of those. In addition to simply proofreading and editing, you will benefit from my two decades as a project manager.  As a result, your materials will be proofed not only for spelling and grammatical errors, but also with respect to context. Nothing is quite as embarrassing (in the written word) as a contextual mistake when comes to the topic of travel or real estate and you benefit from my deep experience with this topic. During the assignment I will provide you with intermediate drafts to make sure you are getting exactly the results you want.    Online/Google Research  Everyone knows how to Google, but few know how to properly research topics using Google. Unfortunately too many researchers give you back a ton of information, poorly organized. This can make your job even harder and consume more time than you planned. (And you are assigning this job, in part to say you time!)  I will professionally research your topic, review the results and organize them in a way that makes it easy for you to get right to the heart of the matter.  For all of my projects I provide intermediate results and an outline of my search plan to confirm we are 'on track' and producing the results that will be most valuable to you - organized in a way that is easy to understand.",Donald H.,2017-02-21,25.0,"January 15, 2015",2,https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~018ddc078b8abe669d,3,4.9895439277

Words transport. Words take you to other dimensions. Words allow you to travel without having to leave the comforts of home. Words expand your mind. Words make you smarter by creating new synapses in your brain and increasing your vocabulary. Words can change lives. Words are an outlet to your deepest thoughts and emotions. Words inspire. The benefits of reading books are infinite and have been widely documented. Writing allows you to express your feeling when spoken words fail you. Writing lets you say the words that need to escape your brain when no one is here to listen. Writing makes ideas travel and turns projects into accomplishments.
