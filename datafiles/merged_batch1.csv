I also will conduct research or interviews as necessary. I am available for writing and editing projects including brochures, books, web content, articles and more. Also will consider proofreading and intensive research projects. Service DescriptionWouldn't it be great to work with people who were truly passionate about what they were doing? Well, that's what you get when you work with me. No matter what I'm learning and writing about I always have fun, and this is why my writing stays fresh and original. I revolve my business around 4 Core Values:1. Honest Relationships2. Decisions Made With Integrity 3. Client Happiness4. My HappinessThis means that every decision that I make in my business must point to those four values. If it doesn't, then I don't do it. What does this mean for you? It means that when you work with me we'll have an honest, open relationship. I'll make decisions with integrity, and I make sure that both you and I are happy with what we're doing together. WHAT YOU GET WITH ME:I am professional and very easy to work with. I also practice the out-dated art of actually sticking to my deadlines. This is my full-time business so my clients ALWAYS come first with me. There is a reason why I have high score here, and it's because I provide excellent copy and excellent service. I'm very good at what I do,and my happy clients are proof of that. It's just good business sense! I do a good job and get repeat clients. You're happy with my service because I'm quick, and happy with the copy because it is exactly what you're looking for. Doesn't take a rocket scientist, right?MY BUSINESS:I am NOT a large firm with a team of writers, which means when you purchase services with The Full Story, you deal directly with me. I am always available should you have questions or concerns, even after regular business hours. I run my business with honesty and integrity. You will ALWAYS get 100% original copy with me. I never ""cut and paste"" or plagiarize in any other way. This is definitely a hot button issue with me. I know other writers do it but I DON'T. My focus is on HIGH QUALITY CONTENT, not junk! You will never have to hire someone else to ""fix"" my work, so if you want it done right the first time then I'm your gal. Sure, you could go with a cheaper writer and then have to hire someone like me to clean it up 2 days before deadline because the copy is terrible and the statistics are all wrong. But life is stressful enough already, so why do that to yourself?Also, I will never leave you hanging on a project. Ever. I've heard horror stories from my previous clients and yes, I take them personally. Again, I know some writers do this but I am not one of them.MY GUARANTEE:I offer all my clients a 100% Satisfaction Guarantee. If you're not happy with the project, and we can't fix it together, I'll refund your money.

Plus, I am an avid outdoorsman and thus, I have considerable expertise in hunting, fishing, firearms, reloading, archery, knives, wilderness survival, urban survival/prepping, herbal medicine, and kayaking and, I have written extensively about each of these subjects. Therefore, not only am I intimately familiar with the outdoor lifestyle, I thoroughly enjoy writing about it.. especially when it allows me to pass my knowledge and experience along to others who find it useful!Concerning my qualifications as a writer, I am a professional outdoor writer and author and, I have been writing professionally for over four years now.

However, although, I have read many different types of education and information books, my fist love is science fiction and therefore, I have read nearly every book written by the masters of the genre such as Arthur C. Clarke, Robert. A. Heinlein, Isaac Asimov and, Frank Herbert. But, my absolute favorite genre is fantasy/adventure and, there again, I have read all of the books by all of the masters such as J.R.R. Tolkien, Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, and George R.R. Martin. Therefore, due to my love of these genres and my expertise as a hunter, fisherman, wilderness survivalist and, a practitioner of herbal medicine, I was more recently hired as a Copy/Line Editor to proofread and edit the post apocalypse survival novel titled Dark Retreat written by Grace Hamilton which is the first book in the EMP Lodge series and which is published on Amazon.Consequently, I am a highly experienced, professional, editor and thus, I can provide you with services ranging from a basic proofread and edit to, line and content editing to, structural and developmental editing.

It should smell fresh to the readers and always feel new no matter how many times they read the same topic. With every word crafted in my one year of article-writing experience, I strive for this unique, fresh writing. I deepened my love for the English language by earning my BS in English Education and discovered the art of clear communication as a substitute teacher at Pensacola Christian Academy. While I taught, I delighted in my writing opportunities. I wrote for several small publications, started a personal blog, practiced some short-story narratives, and even outlined a book idea. If you are searching for a writer who laces information and personality into her writing, you should choose me. I thrive on solid, accurate information and enjoy dotting it with playfulness when appropriate. I also love bending unwieldy sentences back into shape. Because of my academic background, I ground myself in good grammar and writing with purpose, making me ideal as an editor as well.
