My best writing comes when I'm allowed to be informal and conversational and inject a little personality, which this article seems to scream for.----Two things:----First, I work from a Chromebook and I've never taken an hourly job since this site switched from Elance to Upwork. I know they used to require time tracking software that doesn't work on my Chromebook. The simplest solution has always been just to change it to a fixed price job, which by your description would be $90 (5hrs x $18/hr).----Second, since there's no option to attach samples here, if you Google 'wally peterson contently' you'll find an online portfolio of articles I've written.
