I received my Bachelors in Business & Economic Development at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College in Tifton, GA in May 2013 taking such classes as Professional Writing and Research Methods. I graduated with a 3.94 GPA. I am currently in the International MBA program at the University of North Carolina Wilmington with my specialization in International Finance and Investments and will be graduating this upcoming May. As this is a dual-degree, I completed the first half of the program at the University of Applied Sciences in Bremen, Germany last fall. For my first degree, my focus was business and economic development with many hands-on writing projects. For example, I acted as a team member in helping write the business plan and deliver an award-winning presentation at the First Annual University System of Georgia Social Business Plan Competition in 2011. At the University of North Carolina Wilmington, I created a pitch for a platform that connects exercise enthusiasts for the 2014 Innovation Concept Pitch Competition. I received 1st Place for the idea and presentation. During my employment with the Georgia Peanut Commission, I was responsible for social media campaigning, as well as research and promotion efforts. In my position as Business Apprentice for Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College, my primary goal was to manage the operations of the Stafford School of Business. This included maintaining the website, school promotions, and purchases. I had to be a self-starter, flexible, and work well under pressure to excel with this position. I completed an internship last year with Pure Communications, an integrated communications agency specializing in public and investor relations and digital communications for the life sciences industry. I assisted with research, media list development, and proofing materials.I enjoy researching/writing about current trends in the market and am working on my masters thesis about how black swan events impact firm investment behavior.

Together let's live it out.")- Were read for expertise or for laughs in Harvard and University of Chicago "serious" and "comedy-style" publications.- Triggered, in a court of law, this line from the Chief Editor of the Stanford Daily: "He writes better than 99.9% of English native speakers, including myself."  - Resulted in admission of several individuals into top MBA / JD / undergraduate programs in the country via recommendations and/or essay editing (yes, the schools expressly mentioned the writing pieces as key clinching factors).- Sold online things as exciting as brain power or as inspiring as paper stock.- Engendered suggestions from many that I should write for a living.I don't write for a living (yet), but I love writing.  I have deep expertise in business writing, online content / marketing / advertising, and legal / contract writing.  I have managed teams of experts responsible for creating each and often edited their work. I went to some schools where they either teach you to write well, or they teach you to act like you're entitled to have others who write well work for you, or both ... you may want to try me. My day job has been first in various capacities in finance, then advising C-level executives and lawyers as a consultant, and finally occasionally stepping in as an executive-in-residence myself.

Thanks for visiting my profile! I hope you're here because you think I might be a good fit for your job, so I'll briefly fill you in on a couple of relevant things about me:1. I love to write, but I'm not a writer who just proofreads and edits when there aren't any writing gigs. I love grammar and having a part in shaping a document. Nothing makes me happier than well-organized, coherent, error-free writing!2. My schedule - I am self-employed as an educator and freelancer, so I have a pretty flexible schedule and am often available to turn around projects quickly.3. My education - I have a background in theology with a strong reading background and interest in philosophy. (I have a minor in music and am a very serious hobbyist, for whatever that's worth.)4. My experience - I have proofread and edited papers, theses, and dissertations in a variety of disciplines including business, science, technology, humanities, musicology, psychology, and philosophy. This includes a familiarity with many academic style guides (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.). I also have experience working with blog writers and essayists.I have extensive experience with documents by ESL writers.If you have any questions about me, please contact me. I'd be happy to set up a time to chat with you about your project!Thanks,Kristen;Kristen S.;November 3, 2016;15.0;October 26, 2015;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~015e918add8e3d2e2f;4;5.0

For many years, my friends and family members have all solicited my advice and guidance with their cover letters, applications and resumes. The number one thing I have noticed is that it is not experience that inhibits personal success it is branding. I believe that the opportunities you will receive are directly correlated to your ability to invest others in your brand. This might not sound revolutionary- it is not- however what most do not realize is that despite whatever level of investment or belief you have in yourself it is extremely difficult for most people to accurately convey that in written form.Frankly,  I have cultivated this skill in my own life and received grants, scholarships and job prospects that I was perhaps (purely looking at prior experiences) either under qualified for or unqualified for. I was able to ascertain the skills the reviewer/ admissions committee were looking for- both listed and unlisted and leverage the experiences I did have in order to convince them that I was deserving of the opportunity. I would like the opportunity to do that for you.

I have become stronger in my writing since my first post. I will continue to grow in my post with every word. I like a challenge in the work field. I work very well under a deadline. I welcome constructive criticism as well as shown a better way. If it helps me grow in my writers walk. Then please help me run. Highlights of my personal projects are within attachments.

Though I may not have much professional experience to boast about, I do have years of schooling and academic experience still floating about fresh in my fledgling mind.  As I have no major career oriented accomplishments to advertise, and I am still in school, I am left with only myself as a hook, and so I shall attempt to bait it well. Writing has been a growing hobby of mine for the larger part of the past decade. This particular pursuit stems from a passion for the (often times infuriating) english language. I love being capable of creating worlds with the rearranging of twenty-four little letters, captivating the psyche of minds I may never meet outside of the written universe. If you'll let me, I'd like to use these talents to help you "talk" to people in this way, too. Though writing is, and always will be, my main passion, it is not my sole profession. When the ink runs dry, I also freelance as a video/audio transcriptionist, and have worked avidly through many acceptable online companies, the most prominent being Rev.com. I have worked tirelessly to expand my expertise in both fields, and pride myself on the accuracy and alacrity of my finished assignments. My schedule is incredibly flexible, and my hourly rate more so. I hope to hear from you soon!;Phoebe Stacey;March 10, 2016;10.0;October 14, 2015;1;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01ddf30b583d70ac2c;0;5.0

And more importantly am I going to listen and communicate clearly.Language may also be a concern of yours. I am a native English speaker who has previous experience working remotely, and know the communication issues with this type of online work.Affordability is also essential.  Check my rates and consider how much more "bang for the buck". The cheapest may not always be better.   I am trying to give you the best of both worlds.You also want enthusiasm.  Someone who really cares.  Someone who will put in research (on their own time!) and think before suggesting a solution. The worst thing is for you to hire the wrong person, lose time and money, only to have to begin again.  Of course, you also need practical skills.  I am someone who has over three (3) experience with interpreting technical data, developing custom tools for jobs and organizing plans, contacts, actions and data. I am  passionate about writing, researching and organizing thoughts into paper.So why am I here on Upworks?

This means I can flex around YOUR schedule, work on a fixed price project or hourly, whatever suits you.  This also means I can work whatever time of day you would like.

I am a very organized, thoughtful, and creative writer who can adjust to any topic of writing. I put myself into everything I write which is what makes most of my work very relatable whether it is fiction, a real life event, or an opinion piece.

I am a freelance writer with three years of writing experience. Writing has always been my joy! I remember how I wrote short stories on a typewriter as a child, allowing my imagination to run wild -- playing in my mind as a movie in a video-player. Writing is my necessity for living as much as breathing, eating, and sleeping. If I don't write something...anything, I find myself going into a withdrawal, fidgeting, looking for something to write about. I love how words look on both paper and the computer screen,  their distinctive shapes, and the worlds they create. I have written both short stories and poetry during my spare time, developing and constantly improving my craft. I am prepared to supply my service to produce high-quality copywriting, technical writing, creative writing, PowerPoint, voice-acting, and articles.;Aaron Johnson;January 15, 2017;33.33;December 3, 2013;10;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~0159b723d101d207bc;2;4.9854358759

I have already compiled databases of food blogs for two clients. Those data bases were geared toward their individual needs. Both were cookbook authors, one promoting artisinal sodas and the other french cuisine. At present, I am working for Jaime Purviance who is head chef at Weber Grills. I test the website recipes that are sent out to over 500,000 subscribers each Friday. All recipe must adhere to Weber's standards and formatting. Meticulous editing is my specialty. As well I have developed recipes for Melissa's Produce, Driscoll Berries, Casa Noble Tequila and Nest Fresh Eggs to a name a few.On a lighter note - I grew up in New York City and started cooking in my Moms tiny Manhattan kitchen before I can remember. As her loyal steed, we produced cookies, homemade bread and any recipe that tickled our fancy from Gourmet Magazine. I was lucky to grow up on the Upper Westside during its resurgence of eclectic and trendy restaurants, while having Zabaars and Fairway Market at my fingertips.My love of cooking led me to a Bachelor of Science at Cornells School of Hotel Administration where I majored in Food and Beverage, with a minor in wines and food and wine pairing. I worked for a few years in the hotel industry but I ultimately missed the kitchen and compromised on corporate catering.You can view my work at www.virtuallyhomemade.com or www.lizhughesrecipetesting.com.I would love to work with you and your organization.;Elizabeth Hughes;April 20, 2015;16.67;January 8, 2013;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~018377daf268dee02e;0;4.9932045626

Additionally, I have been working in English tutoring, for ESL students, with a focus on TOEFL and SAT preparation. Occasionally, I have dabbled in editing and writing content for various clients and acquaintances. I am looking to broaden my portfolio to include more copy editing and teaching as I have been focused on Web Design for the past 10 years.

You need to look at you traffic, opt-in rates, referrals, etc.TESTIMONIES FROM PREVIOUS UPWORK CLIENTS:"Alex is a great writer and produced some fine articles for me. He has a strong sense of the sales process. I'll hire him again""Alex did a great job understanding our niche and creating content that was not filled with fluff. This was extremely important as the content was for C-level executives.""Alex really impressed me by asking detailed questions before beginning the project. He also suggested several good blog titles and considered SEO implications. Delivery was on time and he made revisions quickly."WHY CLIENTS LOVE AND CHOSE ME:As a web copywriter, I have been able to produce above average opt-in rates, sales, and lead generation. (You can see in my portfolio on how I achieved a 42% email open rate -- 300% above industry average).I have been able to get these results because I take a different approach than most copywriters:1. I look at your entire online funnel. Sometimes, we can get a higher ROI by foucsing on a different part of your business.2. I take the time to DEEPLY understand your customer. I find out what keeps them awake until 3am in the morning, what they dream about, and their frustrations. 3. I use the EXACT language your audience uses (Hint: Men who workout would never say, "I want to fit into those high school jeans.").4. And more...If your copy doesn't catch your audience's attention, connect to them emotionally, and compel them to take action, then nothing else matters. Copy is the key to a successful online business.Imagine being able to double your sales with effective copywriting techniques. What would a 200% increase in your opt-in rate do for your bottom line?If you want content and copy that sells, converts, generates more leads, makes you look good, and gets your audience coming back for more, then hit the "Hire Me" button to invite me to your job posting.

Football is my passion since I was little and since 2010 I'm really glad that I started to turn this hobby of mine into a living. Between 2010 and 2011 I started my career as a sport journalist in my local newspaper, where I was writing articles about all kind of world football news and matches. In the summer of 2011 I had an intership in one of the biggest sport newspapers in my country, where I was also making the daily feed with news and articles about the world football.

He has a complete grasp on marketing and finding unique avenues to transform ideas into realities." --John Hanti, Owner and Executive Producer, the Studios at SST, New York City. HAVING RECENTLY COMPLETED MY FULL-TIME WORK FOR A LONG-TERM CLIENT  I am again free to serve YOU! This client discover me on Upwork before I could accumulate ,many others and now I hope you too will discover the many services I can offer you.IF SALES ARE CRITICAL TO YOUR COMPANY'S EXISTENCE, then trust your sales to an advertising and marketing wizard who can assure your profitable existence for years to come. That would be me :-)I do it all: Copy, art, design, marketing strategy, writing, video production, SEO, websites, email marketing, social media,  and P.R. Incidentally, I am also a nationally known songwriter and producer, as well as former recording artist.In that capacity, my marketing instincts elevated my band to the top echelon of U.S. rock bands. Later, as an entertainment columnist for a Jackson, MS weekly newspaper I continued to earn awards and kudos. My eulogy for John Lennon was personally selected by his widow, Yoko Ono, for inclusion in the first Spirit Foundation book "A Tribute to John Lennon."Landing my first ad agency job as a copywriter and broadcast producer in 1982, I went on to create hundreds of award-winning and sales-winning ad campaigns as a writer and creative director. I served every kind of client and project imaginable for the next 32 years in Jackson, Nashville, and across the country.Passion and emotional intensity are the hallmarks of my work. My writing is exciting, emotional, and motivational. My creative marketing concepts extend far beyond writing. For instance, I created the Dollar General Stores Literacy Foundation, which has directly inspired more than five million DG customers to earn GED certificates or learn how to read. That campaign earned a special Presidential Award (presented to Dollar General Chairman Cal Turner Jr. at the White House) and the Saturday Evening Post Benjamin Franklin Award.You will find here on Upwork many young copywriters raised on the Internet with not a clue about the timeless tried-and-true principles of direct response advertising and major ad agency creative processes. They are not well-grounded in old school masters.  Me? Well, long before the Internet was even dreamed of I was out there drawing customers to my clients. IT DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE!  I instinctively understand human motivation and the language of persuasion. I will put your company on top and ensure the success of your campaign.And if you are not thoroughly delighted with my work you don't have to pay me. That's my guarantee.;Steven Acker;November 9, 2016;30.0;July 26, 2014;28;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~0158f7265a769e3914;0;4.6312900415

Needless to say, I have spent most of my life examining music, and all that relates to it.. what makes it palatable to the listener, what makes it unpalatable, the subtle changes as they occur with time, the not so subtle, the words that define the emotions of millions of listeners around the world, and the instrumentation that guides through each turn. As an instrumentalist, I have been playing guitar since the age of 10, and over the course of time have picked up bass guitar, drums, mandolin, ukulele, banjo, and piano, all in the pursuit of a wide tonal variety. As a writer I began writing songs at an indeterminable young age, continuing to this very day - supplementing with creative short stories and poetry, while studying the lyrics and instrumentation of a wide variety of musicians across the span of time.My extensive creative ability does not limit me to music, rather adds to my overall ability to create for those who may need it. Versatility is key, and crucial to any creative field. It is a goal of mine to constantly extend my knowledge of creative skills while continuing to put them to use for all who demand an exceptional touch.;John Kresse;November 4, 2016;13.0;October 23, 2016;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01dc69b0073f0fd515;0;4.6

My name is Sierra Kautiainen, and I would love to help you with any voice acting or musical work necessary! I sang as an Alto II in Valencia High School Choir for four years and was an Alto II in the Southern Californian Honor Choir. However, my vocal range is quite broad, and I can sing between a low E on the piano to a high B-flat, enabling me to sing up to a Soprano I (high-soprano) range. I have an extensive knowledge of music theory, as I have been playing piano since I was five years old. I attended the prestigious international Soiva music camp on scholarship for piano. I performed a solo in St. Patrick's Cathedral in Ireland. I was also a soloist for many of Valencia Choir's productions and have given over 10 solo performances ranging from Alto II to Soprano I parts. I love singing in any style, from Operatic Arias to jazz. My voice has quite a bit of vibrato, however, so very soft and whispy parts are better suited for other singers. I've been told I have a very "sing-song" voice when I first meet people, but once I get comfortable it can be quite low. I see my vocal range as an asset for any voice acting work. :)I speak English, Finnish, Spanish, and Russian. I love languages and would be happy to audition a script in another language! I speak English and Finnish with my family, so these are my best languages. I'm a pharmacy student at UC Irvine and am in the Honors Program there. I also work in the Piomelli Pharmacology Research Lab in Gillespie Medical Center.

Underscoring all my problem solving quests has been the desire to empower people, and to improve customers experiences, increase profits and leave robust, marketable products. In doing just that, I've developed really broad business skills, including a command of strategic planning, technology, operational excellence, product and program management, coaching, transformation and lean thinking (I'm an accredited LSS Black Belt).

If theres anything Ive learned in that time, its that web design/development is all over the board when it comes to quality and price. On top of that, the web is a constantly growing and evolving technology, and it can be overwhelming for businesses or private professionals to try and develop a web presence without dealing with endless trial and error. Too often I run into people who end up paying an arm and a leg for their website from a large web firm, or end up with a basement designer with little to no experience. Unfortunately, in both cases the work is often inferior.My aim is to make your web presence easy. By working with me, you will have reliable communication,complete transparency, and impeccable quality in every area of your web development and marketing.Good web development isnt just about selling a service. Its also about ethics. If someone is being ripped off, thats bad web development. So even if you dont end up working with me, I would be happy to point you in the right direction. Just give me a call, and I will provide you with reliable, unbiased, and honest advice free of charge. If you like it and want to move forward, Im here to help.Sincerely,E.W Smith;Elliot Smith;February 24, 2017;50.0;June 8, 2013;32;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01c37f127ab99525e5;0;4.9313733414

There were a number of factors that played into this decision, one of them being that I wanted more time to focus on a novel that I have begun writing. Fiction is my main passion in life. In 2010 I had a novella published called Guinea Pig and in February 2012 I started a short fiction blog on WordPress, which is called Huddled In Dirt. During my career I was able to gain promotion to the position of editor of a publishing house in London whereby I was responsible for overseeing the completion of eight bi-annual consumer publications, each of which varied in subject matter and was guest-edited by a celebrity. This demonstrates how dependable, hardworking, meticulous, organised and efficient I am with my work. ;James Massoud;February 24, 2017;14.0;April 19, 2012;3;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~013c3b65c1eec164b7;0;4.8945406195

They will be written in your voice (informative, technical, informal, conversational, academic) and reflect your unique point of view.Proofreading/Editing---------------------------Your materials will be professionally and rigorously proofread with suggested changes highlighted in Microsoft Word using the Track Changes feature. (Other options available if you prefer, just ask.) Editing isn't just looking for spelling mistakes and checking for punctuation errors, it is about improving and tightening your materials to make them better, my editing always matches your desired tone for the intended audience (conversational, web content or academic) or a combination.In addition to proofreading/Editing, you will benefit from my nearly 30 years of experience as a practicing family, cosmetic and orthodontic dentist.Online/Google Research---------------------------------Everyone knows how to Google, but few know how to properly research topics using Google. Unfortunately too many researchers give you back a ton of information, poorly organized. This can make your job even harder and consume more time than you planned. (And you are assigning this job, in part to save you time!)I will professionally research your topic, review the results and organize them in a way that makes it easy for you to get right to the heart of the matter.;John Horsley;July 28, 2015;55.56;February 23, 2013;5;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01150c928e0f62038c;0;5.0

Through my experiences, I have learned how to work with people in a team environment, be webmaster for the team website (providing content and materials),  setting and achieving goals, and how to think outside the box.  - 2013 University of Delaware Study Abroad Media Ambassador- I managed a Tumblr for study abroad in Greece, posted pictures, and stories about the trip, - The University used the photos for promotion on their Facebook, and for other promotional events.

NATIVE SPEAKERI grew up in a mountain town close to Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil. During my formative years I studied basic French, German, and English but my college classes included Portuguese, Greek, Latin, Literature, and Linguistics. I also studied Spanish and English.ADVANCED ENGLISH - I moved to the United States 29 years ago. New York was my home for 10 years but I currently reside in Florida. - My business specialty was videotaping depositions, which gave me a good understanding of the Legal, Technical, and Medical terminology. - Another area I have quite a lot of experience is Real Estate, both residential and commercial. - I am an avid handbag maker, and I enjoy many arts & crafts projects.PROJECTS1) Teaching English & Cultural Adaptation While working in Real Estate, I formed a partnership with a Brazilian PhD Psychologist to develop a cultural adaptation program directed at assisting Brazilian expatriates, businesspersons and families who moved to the metropolitan area of Tampa, FL, not only to learn the everyday language but also to understand what they could expect and what would be expected of them during their stay in the United States.2) Translating a Large WebsiteEtsy.com started their translation efforts to translate the whole site into Portuguese around August 2012. I have been in their translation team ever since. They'd asked me to assume a Leadership position around December of that year, which I was glad to accept. The project involves the continuous translation of thousands of strings, first into the European Portuguese and, on a second phase, into the Brazilian Portuguese, using an online translation platform.3) Blog WritingI have written a number of articles for different blogs. I enjoy researching new subjects but my favorite blog themes are arts, crafts, toys, and accessories. 4) Technical Document Translations- Petroleum platform training documents.. legal letters.. architectural project presentation.- Income Taxes, Birth Certificates, and Bank Statements- Quality Manuals5) Movie Subtitles (2 movies, partial work)Please contact me directly to discuss your project volume, time expectation for its conclusion, and its budget.

During my university years, the last year of which was spent at Middlesex University in London with an Erasmus Scholarship, I have developed excellent writing skills in English at a proficiency level, which I was able to put into practice professionally while working as a freelancer here on the Odesk platform, writing articles, web content, editing and proofreading documents. From my additional work experience I can extrapolate a particular emphasis on customer service and working in a team, especially at my previous jobs, both in the United States and the United Kingdom. I have proven to be a flexible and adaptable person, willing to take initiative, particularly given my volunteer work as an editor on a TV review website at the age of seventeen. During this volunteering period, I have demonstrated working well of my own accord, with no supervision. Having successfully balanced my academic and professional commitments, I believe it showcases my strong skills in time management and activity coordination, of working well under pressure, as well as a willingness to take on responsibility. I speak Romanian and English fluently and, regarding the latter, I would like to insist upon my spoken and written capabilities. From the very beginning of my university degree, I showcased a near-native level of English, and I will attach a letter of recommendation from an American Fulbright Junior Lecturer that taught at my university during my first year as confirmation of that statement. Furthermore, the subsequent four months of living in the United States and the ten months spent in United Kingdom definitely provided me with a useful medium towards cultivating an even greater knowledge of English.;Marian C.;December 1, 2014;8.89;February 27, 2012;3;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01eefa4b03ae930f70;4;5.0

I can, touch type, work under pressure and short time limits while still producing top quality work. I am extremely committed and will only settle once I have produced top quality work. I love creative writing or producing any work which allows me to use my imagination.I have completed senior high school with the highest exit mark of an OP1 and have completed one semester of 3rd year Spanish at university. I have won the Language Perfect International Spanish competition twice out of 75000 participants. I participated in a Spanish immersion program where all my subjects were taught in Spanish and all tests and assignments were completed in Spanish for three years in the junior school. For this reason, I am well accustomed to writing large Spanish documents to the highest standard. I was also Dux (highest achieving student) of grades 9, 10, 11 and 12 Spanish. Additionally, I studied in Spain for a month and I fluently speak Castilian Spanish. I love the language and am keen to continue broadening and improving my language skills through writing and translating documents.I have a diploma DELE (Spanish Diploma as a Foreign Language) which is an internationally recognized diploma - I received the level B2 or Advanced Diploma in Spanish. In addition, I have a vary high level of English and have won various awards for the subject during high school including the Dux of grade 10 and 11 English.I have completed multiple translation projects to the satisfaction of the client and am currently providing spanish tutoring to various students in the local area.I am flexible and can easily adapt to the task at hand and I hope to be of assistance for your project.;Makenzie M.;March 18, 2014;16.67;June 23, 2012;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~01f16e644f1ed47653;8;5.0

When I work on content for my clients, I strive to provide them with the highest quality literature possible - I feel that there is nothing worse than reading an article that is full of spelling mistakes and glaringly obvious grammatical errors, not to mention plagiarism! I am currently saving to complete a proofreading course so that I will be able to "officially" add that skill to my repertoire.. for now, however, I spend my working hours writing quality content for clients both here and on other freelancing platforms - you will see from my feedback that my clients have been very pleased with the work I have completed for them.. I even have long-term clients who continue to hire me for more work.I am available to research and write content on a number of subjects including health, education, current affairs, history, science, philosophy, frugal living and parenting. I have a wide range of interests and love nothing more than delving into a subject to learn as much as possible about it, which is certainly a helpful quality when it comes to researching content for clients.I am a native British English speaker, living in the UK and I am fluent in both written and verbal English. I possess 8 GCSEs and 2 A-Levels, one in English Literature at grade B and one in Psychology at grade C.. I intend to start studying a part-time degree course next year with the Open University. I am not afraid to ask as many questions as I feel are necessary to help me ensure that I can provide high quality content that meets my client's specifications.Whilst I do try to ensure that I communicate regularly with my clients, in order to touch base or discuss the work, I do have children and, therefore, arrange my working hours around them. If I am not online during the day, I can usually be contacted urgently if need be because I do check my emails sporadically throughout the day and will reply as soon as possible if the query is urgent and cannot wait until I am next online. I know that my reliability when it comes to communication is one of the things my clients really like about me and the service that I provide.;Cassie R.;June 14, 2016;15.0;March 25, 2013;0;https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/_~015422485c0b0cbd7c;4;4.9698333694

I have completed a rigorous senior thesis course that culminated with the completion of a research paper written in accordance with current accepted APA style.  Also, note the low amounts of time taken for my various tests I have passed.  I took these tests without any prior study that was particularly geared toward any one test.  I feel that by doing so, these tests more accurately reflect a baseline of my skill level than if I had studied at all for any of these tests which would have temporarily artificially inflated my scores.
