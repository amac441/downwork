I am the short or long term solution you hoped to find when you began this search. I have served as an unforgettable decision made to companies and individuals for the last decade. The shocking detail of my success stories has usually been the quality of my service or performance without prior experience. It's simply magic. To this point I have not found a necessity to acquire any degree. Some agree and of course others do not, but I have always found my way to opportunity I technically did never qualify for. I have my Resume and Cover Letters, my presentation, and relentless work ethic to blame for this.
